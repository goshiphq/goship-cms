Supply chain management is an essential part of the business. Even if you are a small business owner, taking care of your supply chain is key to efficiency and profitability. No matter the complexity of your supply chain, it can still be a challenge to [manage it](https://www.plslogistics.com/blog/supply-chain-strategy-3-options-for-better-management/). However, there are a few cornerstone aspects that you need to consider to make your supply chain operate smoothly.

Key aspects of efficient supply chain management:
-------------------------------------------------

### 1\. Visibility

One of the critical features of a working supply chain is transparency within every part of it. It is crucial to see how the processes are running from production to retail. First of all, it keeps all parts of the supply chain organized. Secondly, it helps find errors quicker and enhance efficiency. To achieve visibility in the supply chain, it is highly recommended to utilize technology for tracking and data storing which is crafted specifically for supply chain management needs.

### 2\. Reliable transportation

Transportation is the glue in the supply chain, and any disruption on the way causes a domino effect. Looking into your [transportation strategy](https://www.goship.com/blog/optimizing-your-truckload-shipping-strategy/) and thoroughly analyzing it will help you determine adjustments that need to be made. Make sure you work with reliable shipping services and freight carriers. The more effective is your transportation, the better will be your supply chain as a whole.

### 3\. Integration

Having an integrated supply chain is a must for efficiency. This means that all branches of your supply chain have to be connected, and the communication with each link needs to be clear and concise. As in transportation, an error in one part of the process hinders all the following efforts, which often leads to lost costs and frustration. Having a good communication strategy and trusted relationships with your business partner is crucial for supply chain efficiency, profitability, and productivity.
