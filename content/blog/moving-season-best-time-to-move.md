## When is the best time to move?

Usually, it is recommended to arrange your relocation during the off-season. Starting in late September and through mid-spring, there is a big chance to move without rushing and breaking a budget. Most of the shipping services have loose schedules compared to the summer season, and moving rates are comparably low.

## How to survive the moving season?

In two different parts of the country, the busy season can be a completely different time.
