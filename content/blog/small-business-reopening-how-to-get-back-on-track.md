There is a lot of controversy around the topic of [reopening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html) the US economy and how to handle the pandemic further. One way or another, we are going to return to our regular life in a short time. Many small businesses [already have](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-coronavirus-trnd/) a carte blanche for reopening and getting back to work. Amongst all of the responsibilities businesses will have to face, there is one clear thing about this process: nothing is going to happen overnight. There won’t be a day where everything suddenly becomes as it was before. The comeback will be gradual, phased, and strategized. Many small businesses [were affected](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-can-small-businesses-survive-coronavirus-recession/) by the pandemic and are now worrying about how they can reopen most effectively and safely. Creating a reopening strategy can be very useful for a smooth entering of the market in the new conditions. The recovery will come in waves and eventually, the demand for your products will increase. You should be fully prepared for this increase and have inventory and shipping strategies in place.

How will small businesses reopen?
---------------------------------

### Outlining the stages

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for businesses, especially at this time. The first thing you will need to do is sit down with your team and create a plan with detailed stages of how you will return to business activity. Depending on the type of business and the current situation you are in, define the area that needs an immediate reaction and the ones that can be launched later.

### Renewing relationships

Generally, it is good to start renewing connections with all your partners, shipping providers, suppliers, and vendors to see where they are at the moment. This way you can figure out whether you can start processes or need to find a new supplier. With that being said, making estimates on average delivery times both inbound and outbound can help set realistic expectations for your customers and your business. A crucial step here is to [understand your customers](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-communicate-the-coronavirus-pandemic-to-your-customers/) at the moment. You should identify whether they need your product, how you can extend the market, and how they will respond to your messages.

### Returning employees

Once you have an action plan set up, you can start getting your workforce back into their physical workplace. Essentially, this should follow a certain consequence. Firstly, remote and laid-off workers should return. People in a vulnerable zone should come back later under safety measures. Arrange a safety policy and supply your employees with everything they need for safe operating.

### Supply and demand balance

As the customer demand grows, keep an eye on how the pace of this demand increases and pay attention to the new trends in customer behavior. They will most likely change, and it is important to adjust to successfully roll out into the new market. If you don’t have a polished online strategy, consider updating it immediately!
