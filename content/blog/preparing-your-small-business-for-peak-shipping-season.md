The produce shipping season is slowly coming to an end, marking the beginning of the busiest time in freight transportation - peak season. The peak period usually starts at the end of August and lasts throughout October. Autumn is a busy time for a lot of reasons: the back-to-school season starts, and many small businesses prepare early for the holiday season, which is closer than it seems to be. Despite the pandemic times and economic uncertainty, companies are getting ready to increase their sales and production. The key to success is thorough planning, and the earlier your business starts this phase, the better. Here are a few useful tips on how to get prepared for the busy peak season as a small business:

How do you prepare your small business for the peak season?
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 1\. Shop for competitive rates

Now is the best time to start shopping around for competitive freight rates, expand your freight carrier network, and secure truck capacity. The closer it gets to the peak season, the more expensive freight rates will get and capacity will start to shrink. By planning in advance, your company can get the best service for a reasonable price and be sure that your shipments will be delivered on time.

### 2\. Build relationships with suppliers & carriers

Recent events in the global economy have shown companies that they need to be more flexible and resilient. Keep this in mind while entering the new season, and make sure you have good communication with your partners: carriers, suppliers, and shipping services. It is a great time to find more reliable partners to work with to be safe.

### 3\. Use data to plan

Though it is hard to predict customer behavior and demand right now, analyzing your previous sales and operation strategy may help define mistakes that were made and fix them this time. Check your inventory, make sure all the facilities are set up for the peak sales season, and of course, ensure safety for your employees and customers.
