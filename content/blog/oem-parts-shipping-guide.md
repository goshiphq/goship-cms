Are you debating between an OEM vs. aftermarket parts for your business? Shipping OEM parts can be time-consuming, expensive, and risky. You will need to find ways on how to transport your OEM products securely and on time. Find out the difference between an OEM and aftermarket parts and the best shipping methods if you opt for OEM parts.  

## OEM Parts Definition 

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. OEM parts match those that come with an original product. They are of the same quality as a product’s original parts. Some of the most in-demand industries for OEM parts include:  

* Auto parts  
* Electronics 
* Apparel and zippers  
* Software and operating systems 
* Energy supplies (solar panels). 

In this blog, we will focus primarily on OEM auto parts. 

## OEM vs. Aftermarket Parts for Suppliers 

 \
Aftermarket parts are also replacement parts, but a different manufacturer makes them. Choosing to supply aftermarket and OEM parts will depend on your customer’s budget, type of repair, and quality needed.  

### Pricing 

Most OEM parts will typically cost 60% more than their counterpart aftermarket parts. Because of their affordability, most insurance companies will opt for aftermarket parts while dealership repair shops will only offer OEM parts. 

### Availability 

OEM parts are more difficult to source than aftermarket parts, so you will most likely need to find a certified supplier.  

Additionally, most genuine OEM parts will only be made available after the production run has ended. They are not necessarily spare parts –– some OEM parts are made nearly identical to the original parts by the same manufacturer. 

### Cosmetic 

These parts affect how a vehicle looks and functions, such as trim, fenders, and rims, but they don’t impact vehicle safety during accidents. For auto parts, since cosmetic parts don’t affect crashworthiness or safety, choosing cosmetic OEM parts is a matter of budget and availability. 

### Structural Safety  

OEM parts are typically more durable when faced with constant wear and tear. Aftermarket parts should also follow the standards and guidelines set by a certified organization. For auto parts, these should be certified by the Certified Automobile Parts Association to account for full-functionality and safety. 

### Versatility 

Most aftermarket parts are designed to apply to more than one product. While that may be a good thing, it’s not ideal. This is especially the case if you’re dealing with safety and risky functions, such as auto parts replacement. 

### Warranty  

No matter the case, you should always check the warranty of the parts to maximize your money’s worth. Typically, OEM parts will have superior warranty terms over aftermarket parts. OEM and aftermarket parts will not usually affect product warranty.

## OEM Parts Shipping Practices  

One of the biggest industries that supply OEM parts is the automotive industry. However, it can get tricky as OEM auto parts are heavy, large, and oddly shaped. For the sake of discussion, let’s discuss shipping practices for auto OEM parts: 

### Approval and Requirement 

 

Get in touch with your freight carrier of choice and inquire whether they carry the parts you have in mind. 

For auto body parts, the most common parts requested by OEMs and Tier 1-3 suppliers include: 

* Mechanical auto parts (transmissions, engine blocks, batteries, brakes, entertainment systems, and safety tools) 
* Auto body parts (bumpers, fenders, wheels, windshields, dash assemblies) 
* Raw goods and materials (steel, aluminum, resin) 

 

Each auto part will entail different processes and requirements. The best course of action is to communicate with your [freight carrier](https://www.goship.com/) for the best method. 

### Available shipping methods  

If you are shipping auto parts heavier than 150 pounds, your best choice is to go for truckload or LTL shipping. For smaller and lighter parts that can fit in boxes or crates, parcel shipping is sufficient. 

### Packaging considerations  

Packaging will depend mainly on the shape and fragility of your items. You might need to consider extra wrapping or padding for highly fragile items. In some cases, parts need to be disassembled. 

### Tracking your shipment 

 

Reliable freight carriers will offer frequent and convenient tracking options for you. Make sure to keep your bill of lading close at hand to check the status of your shipment up until it reaches its final destination.
