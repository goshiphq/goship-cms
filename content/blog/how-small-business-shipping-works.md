Owning a small business is not easy. You have to manage most things by yourself and operate a high volume of responsibilities, which is exhausting. If you’re running a small business that is linked with manufacturing or retailing goods, how do you arrange proper shipping? While striving to maintain operational efficiency, high-level customer service, and focus on marketing, thinking about shipping can be very exhausting. Many companies overlook the importance of good shipping services. However, [transportation can play a significant role in your customers’ experience](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/) and therefore affect revenue. Apart from your customers’ satisfaction, convenient shipping can benefit your business in many different ways.

**What are the options?**
-------------------------

There are many choices when it comes to business shipping. Depending on the volume of items you’re shipping and your customer demand, you can use many logistics options. Ultimately, it all comes down to two main alternatives: parcel shipping and freight shipping. **Parcel shipping** is one of the most common types of shipping. It suggests items weighing less than 150 pounds, and are less than 165 inches in combined length and girth. If the package length is 108 inches, the girth must not exceed 67 inches. **Freight shipping** is how most of the goods in the world are moved. If your shipment weighs more than 150 lbs, exceeds 108 inches in length and 165 inches in girth – it’s considered freight.

**What is the best option for business shipping?**
--------------------------------------------------

Most of the shippers consider only regular parcel services for their business needs. However, package services are not always the best way of high-quality and affordable transportation. If you are sending a large number of parcels or large items, you should think of other options rather than just looking at regular shipping services. While parcel services can often charge too much per parcel cost, your freight volume might be not enough for full truckload freight shipping. There's no reason to worry - there is a balance between the two options called less-than-truckload, or [LTL shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/5-key-benefits-of-ltl-shipping-for-retail-businesses/).

**What are LTL online shipping services?**
------------------------------------------

More and more [individuals and businesses are switching to online shipping services](https://www.goship.com/blog/benefits-of-using-an-online-shipping-service/). Online shipping services provide shipping solutions for small businesses and individual shippers without dealing with brokers or carriers. Whether you need to transport large items, multiple pallets full of goods, or over-sized parcel that ordinary delivery services don’t accept, online LTL shipping companies can help. Online services operate as a self-service, online platform that connects you to a wide network of professional carriers and drivers. Whether it is bulky items or supplies for your business, the shipping process can be simple.

**How does it work?**
---------------------

For most of the services, all you need to do is to log onto the website, set your requirements and choose from a variety of available carriers. Online shipping platforms save you tons of time, while less-than-truckload allows you to move goods at an affordable price. Since shipment tracking and visibility are crucial to small businesses, online services provide transparent tracking and 24/7 access at every step of the delivery.
