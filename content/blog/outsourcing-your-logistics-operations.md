Third-party logistics (3PL) offer a variety of efficient and cost-friendly freight services and outsourced logistics that are necessary for remaining competitive in any business. The strength of your logistics operations is the backbone to meeting customer demand, driving sales, and preparing for business growth.

What are logistics operations? 
-------------------------------

Logistics operations refer to the part of the supply chain that involves moving products from a manufacturer to the client or end-user. The inbound and outbound logistics consist of various operations that require a lot of manpower and finances. It involves everything from inventory to fulfillment, packaging, and shipment of orders. Outsourcing logistics with a third-party logistics company is vital to a sustainable business. 3PLs will handle all operations, including warehousing, transportation, and delivery, for an efficient and cost-effective solution.

Why are logistics operations important? 
----------------------------------------

Logistics operations involve many moving processes that can be difficult to track. This can be detrimental to your business as it can lead to high carrying costs, deadstock, or maybe even stockouts that cause shipping delays. Streamlining logistics operations allows businesses to cut loose ends that adversely affect profit and customer satisfaction. Specifically, a streamlined logistics process can help cut down costs, reduce human error and risk, keep your customers happy, and ultimately drive up future revenue.

What are the benefits of outsourcing logistics? 
------------------------------------------------

Outsourcing logistics is becoming widely popular today due to their superior strategies and customized services.  Some of the main benefits of outsourced logistics include:

### 1\. Managed freight budget

By outsourcing logistics operations, you can find a 3PL that specializes in managed freight services. This will ensure that you can fit expenses according to a predictable freight budget, along with increased opportunities for financial success.

### 2\. Managing rate shopping disruptions

An experienced outsource logistics company has industry-tested strategies and knowledge to manage the unpredictable ups and downs of the freight market. This means you never have to risk any financial losses due to mishandling situations outside your expertise.

### 3\. Access to the leading freight carriers

Your business reputation lies heavily in customer satisfaction. An outsourced logistics provider can provide you access to some of the best freight carriers, many of which would be impossible to find on your own. Outsourced logistics companies can introduce you to logistics professionals along the supply chain, which will allow you to foster meaningful business relationships that will translate to better service for your customers.

### 4\. Risk Management

Distributors and manufacturers are increasingly at risk due to changing government regulations and negotiating contracts. Engaging with an outsourced logistics company will allow your business to mitigate risk and have additional insurance.

### 5\. Reduced back-office tasks

Logistics operations require a lot of manpower and organization of systems. Most outsourced logistics providers already have sufficient manpower and operations in place that can process, manage, and audit bills efficiently within a shorter period. Handing over these in-depth operations to a logistics provider will free up your time to focus on more critical operations like product development and customer service.

### 6\. Access to Transportation Management System (TMS)

TMS helps a logistics platform that uses automation and technology to plan, execute, and optimize outbound and inbound movement of goods. An efficient TMS in place is costly to research, invest in, and implement. With an outsourced logistics provider, you will have access to a secure, efficient, and flexible TMS that will give you an edge over competitors still using manual methods. TMS will give you access to a centralized and integrative portal as well as reporting and analytics.
