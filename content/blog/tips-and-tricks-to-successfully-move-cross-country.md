While any move can be stressful, moving cross country is usually perceived as the most stressful type because many additional burdens and costs can accompany it. There are so many things to keep track of while maintaining your budget.

# How to move cross-country?

Whether you need to find the best way to move freight across the country or change location and need to relocate your stuff, moving can be a smooth and positive experience with the help of modern shipping services. It might not be too comforting to review and pack all of your belongings to send them miles away, but with the proper preparation, you can move across the country conveniently and for a reasonable price. If you have many essential items and constantly worry about shipping your items to your new location, here is a guide on moving cross-country properly.



### Cargo downsizing

Do you really need that old sofa? It may surprise you, but it might be cheaper to buy items in a new place instead of transporting them to another part of the country, depending on which shipping service you decide to use. The more items you want to ship, the more costly the delivery gets. You will probably need to rent a truck or several large vehicles to condense all the interior pieces. Take the time to make a detailed review of the things you actually need and get rid of all the unnecessary elements. 



Check all the items in your home and define the ones that are still useful and in good condition, as well as the stuff you don’t need. You can sell various types of oversized or underused items, ranging from old furniture to pieces of equipment. You can also take some good pictures and put them on Craigslist. It is one of the ways to make your moving process beneficial and easier to organize.

### Correct packaging

It doesn’t matter what moving alternative you choose – DIY, friends, or a shipping service – packing is your part in the shipment process. Protection of your cargo is essential for secure transportation. Make sure to buy the right cardboard boxes, pallets, and packing materials, such as industrial tapes. It’s better to put more layers on the entire package to make sure the freight is safe. Besides, consider applying [shipping pallets](https://www.goship.com/posts/a-guide-to-different-types-of-shipping-pallets) to provide additional fixating of the cargo inside the truck.



When it comes to packing – more is better than less. While many shipping companies provide reliable options for fragile items’ shipping, it’s probably better to count on yourself, especially if you are moving your grandma’s antique cup collection. Take the most fragile objects with you in your hand luggage while flying to the destination. While this is a best practice, shippers typically don’t have enough time or necessary supplies to pack the items properly. For this case, it’s better to use professional services. GoShip partners with [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/), a helping service where you can request taskers to pack, load, and unload your items.
