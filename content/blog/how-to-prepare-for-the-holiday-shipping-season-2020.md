## Navigating the Winter Shipping Season 2020

### Focus on e-commerce

For manufacturers and retailers, this season will be all about online sales. Small businesses with solid e-commerce strategies will be positioned to succeed despite market volatility. Over the past few years, the number of e-commerce holiday sales has been steadily growing. But this year, [experts estimate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2020/08/01/3-emerging-e-commerce-growth-trends-to-leverage-in-2020/#4522f646feec) record-breaking growth due to safety concerns. Make sure you have a strong online presence and that you have enough operational capacity to sustain demand. An efficient order fulfillment process should be a top priority for small businesses during this shipping season.

### Flexibility and diversity

For small businesses, it's common to only work with a few partners, maintaining a small network of vendors, manufacturers, and carriers. However, this season [will be different](https://www.goship.com/blog/make-your-supply-chain-management-more-efficient/). Due to strain on supply chains, lean operations no longer cover all your bases.  Now is a great time to rethink your communications and partnerships, find new reliable options, and capitalize on the wealth of innovative partners.

### Adapt to the new conditions

One of the key forecasts for the winter shipping season of 2020 is slowed shipping. Because e-commerce is growing, you should expect tight capacity and slower transit times. One way around this is to [book trucks ahead of time](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-get-the-best-freight-rate-in-current-conditions/).
