2020 has been tough for small businesses. The COVID crisis and ensuing economic fallout have disrupted practically every industry, and this year's peak shipping season is right around the corner. This is an opportunity to capitalize on increased consumer activity towards the end of the year for many companies. There are concrete steps organizations can take to bounce back as consumer activity increases and shipping skyrockets despite the high level of uncertainty and unpredictability in the market and economy.

Navigating the Winter Shipping Season 2020
------------------------------------------

### Focus on e-commerce

For manufacturers and retailers, this season will be all about online sales. Small businesses with solid e-commerce strategies will be positioned to succeed despite market volatility. Over the past few years, the number of e-commerce holiday sales has been steadily growing. But this year, [experts estimate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2020/08/01/3-emerging-e-commerce-growth-trends-to-leverage-in-2020/#4522f646feec) record-breaking growth due to safety concerns. Make sure you have a strong online presence and that you have enough operational capacity to sustain demand. An efficient order fulfillment process should be a top priority for small businesses during this shipping season.

### Flexibility and diversity

For small businesses, it's common to only work with a few partners, maintaining a small network of vendors, manufacturers, and carriers. However, this season [will be different](https://www.goship.com/blog/make-your-supply-chain-management-more-efficient/). Due to strain on supply chains, lean operations no longer cover all your bases.  Now is a great time to rethink your communications and partnerships, find new reliable options, and capitalize on the wealth of innovative partners.

### Adapt to the new conditions

One of the key forecasts for the winter shipping season of 2020 is slowed shipping. Because e-commerce is growing, you should expect tight capacity and slower transit times. One way around this is to [book trucks ahead of time](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-get-the-best-freight-rate-in-current-conditions/). As the shipping season ramps up, you can start actively searching for [freight rates](https://www.goship.com/) and convenient transportation options with ease. Don’t forget to check out shipping deadlines and plan your operations accordingly.
