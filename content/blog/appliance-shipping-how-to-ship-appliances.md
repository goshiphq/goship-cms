Without the use of a semitrailer, shipping appliances can be challenging. However, you won't be shipping enough to fill the trailer most of the time. That is, you will be charged for space in the trailer that you will not be using. Another alternative is to hire a private car to transport your appliances. This, however, can be more costly than renting a semitrailer. You'll also need to have someone from your company take time off to make the appliance delivery.

## How to ship appliances?

Refrigerators, dishwashers, and stoves, for example, must be shipped with extreme caution to avoid damage.

* Refrigerators should be defrosted at least 24 hours ahead of time.
* Remove all shelves and drawers and box them separately.
* Separately clean and pack ovens, racks, knobs, and grills.
* Hoses should be removed from washers and dryers, and the drum of the dryer should be tightly fastened.
* To avoid falling open during transit, any appliances with doors should be taped and secured.
