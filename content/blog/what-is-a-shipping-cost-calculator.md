## **What is a shipping cost calculator?**

A shipping cost calculator is a robust software solution used to calculate the best shipping rates and services for you and your customers. As you know, shipping costs are the direct cost of moving items from a store/warehouse or online store to a customer's doorstep. This tool is designed to make shipping rates and service details available to its users in a quick and easy-to-read format. It typically includes pricing and current operational details, origin and destination facilities, and available shipping services.

## **What factors are used by a shipping cost calculator?**

A shipping cost calculator uses various factors, which we have described below. Each has its value, and you must understand them carefully. Once you know what factors will affect your shipping prices, you can ultimately use them to find ways to save on your shipment. So, let's take a look at the main factors used by a shipping cost calculator.

* Freight Weight and Dimensions
* Distance
* Truck Capacity

* Shipping Tracking and Insurance
* Delivery Timing
