**What is a trade show?**
-------------------------

If you are a small business owner at starting to ramp up your marketing efforts, a trade show can be a great opportunity to promote products and services. However, trade show shipping can be a burden. A registration fee to participate is required in most cases, however, many businesses don’t know that shipping all their commodities in and out can be more expensive than participating in the show.

Knowing the background of trade show shipping will help you [choose a reliable and cost-efficient option](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-save-on-trade-show-shipping_b_5a4cd29de4b06cd2bd03e394?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWFyY2hsaWdodC5jb25kdWN0b3IuY29tLzE2NTUwL3dlYi1wcm9wZXJ0aWVzLzg0MTM0L3RvcGljcy82NDIwMjQ_cmFua1NvdXJjZUlkPTEmc2VlZFBocmFzZT10cmFkZStzaG93K3NoaXBwaW5nJmRhdGFiYXNlUmFua1NvdXJjZUlkPTE&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB6xoFjHg257bZham8ej9nb7CSuD2s6uGbkj-fC-7cDRZO215HTHfSCc92GGCf6oblVLK8zPwtpcHNm9S5_XgQKnLiPUq9-P6SzLM6dlHgRk-IGa6_gSeG4GT8-OYWZbDyE0MFv6zr228KbtksJnj89U7dNAptTMwEF2qD1gNlGt). Essentially, there is a way to avoid additional fees and high charges, if you properly plan and organize your strategy. Here are a few helpful tips for a successful trade show shipping experience. 

### **Don’t always choose the official carrier**

On many trade shows and exhibitions, there are official trade show shipping services. However, don’t rush into deploying them right away. Chances are that the official carrier may charge more than other options. Take a look at your regional haulers, especially [LTL carriers,](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-ltl-carriers/) and compare their rates. Also, make sure that the chosen carrier is aware of the fact you’re shipping to the trade show. It is important information to mention, otherwise, you might end up with a canceled pickup. 

### **Present an accurate BOL at pickup**

To ensure your products are delivered safely and on time, it’s critical to provide an accurate [bill of lading](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-the-bill-of-lading-bol/) at the pickup. Make sure to write down all the necessary information, including:

*   Booth number
*   Delivery address
*   Delivery date
*   Name of your company 
*   Contacts 
*   Number of products

The correct documentation will help you avoid misunderstandings with carriers and possible delays. 

### **Think about reverse transportation**

Trade shows can be a mess: people take their products for 1 or 2-day exhibition in one area at the same time, and then have to ship it all out. That’s why it is crucial to arrange reverse transportation in advance. If you won’t ship your products in a timely manner, they will most likely be moved to the trade show storage, which can result in additional costs.  Ultimately, trade show shipping [can be less stressful](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-the-cheapest-way-to-ship-large-packages/) and cost-efficient when you plan ahead. Do your research on the carriers, prepare the paperwork and arrange shipments to and from the exhibition.
