Planning temperature-controlled shipments can be extremely complicated because the slightest disruption could lead to spoiled products and lost sales. Reefers, or [refrigerated trucks](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-refrigerated-shipping-and-how-does-it-work/), handle 90% of all food distributed through the U.S. 

Aside from meat, dairy, and fresh produce, frozen equipment is also used to carry medicine, flowers, electronics, fine art, cosmetics, and other products that require climate control during transportation. To keep your cold shipments efficient and profitable, you can use several practices for refrigerated shipping to improve your supply chain performance.

## 3 Best Practices for Refrigerated Freight Shipping

Once you have defined whether your products need to be chilled, frozen, or deep-frozen, you can start utilizing best practices for cold shipping to eliminate disruptions.

### Plan ahead, load fast

For the refrigerated shipping process, advanced planning is the key. This encompasses all aspects of your supply chain, from the inventory to the loading process. First, make sure the items are properly packed and stacked before loading. Once a certain loading time is arranged, make sure to be on time and load your freight quickly. Some products, like food and produce, require a faster delivery than electronics and cosmetics, so consider the unique temperature requirements for your type of freight.

### Have a wide network of carriers

Having an extensive pool of carriers gives you more chances to pick high-service, top-performing reefer carriers to handle your goods. Also, this means that in the case of shipping failure, delay, or disruption, you can quickly switch to another provider without time losses. The variety of carriers helps assure that all the requirements for the different product types are met.

### Use the retail compliance program

The best way to avoid unwanted issues related to shipping is to prearrange all the terms and conditions with your shipping provider. For retailers, the most reliable way to do so is to set up a [retail compliance program](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-a-vendor-compliance-program-retail/). In this mutual agreement, both parties outline the requirements and conditions for partnership, as well as determine an action plan and charges in case of violation of this agreement. Refrigerated shipping is an important part of global supply chains and provides people around the world with food, medicine, and other essential goods. Safety is a primary concern for these shipments, so make sure to properly organize your shipping process.
