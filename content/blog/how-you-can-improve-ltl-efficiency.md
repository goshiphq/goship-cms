Shipping efficiency provides a double benefit for both the carrier and the shipper. Knowing how to maximize your efficiency as a shipper will accelerate all future shipments. As a shipper, reducing your cost and time spent is important. Simply by choosing the right shipping methods, you will increase LTL efficiency.

The next time you plan to ship LTL, consider these improvements:
----------------------------------------------------------------

### **Ship from an ideal location**

Shipping close to a metropolitan area reduces the likelihood of delayed freight and reduces your costs. Metropolitan areas usually have a larger concentration of carriers and shipping terminals.

### **Have an open time frame**

Giving your carrier more time to move your freight will save you money, simple, right?

### **Palatalize your loads**

Pallets not only keep your freight secure, but they also keep costs low. Pallets will be easy and fast for your carrier to load. Also, if your pallet can be stacked, it becomes a space saver.

### **Consolidate your freight**

If you have multiple items going to a single location, try to ship them at the same time. This will reduce the number of shipments you have to create and reduce the amount of packaging needed.

### **Have your freight ready before the carrier arrives**

Coordinate a system with a pick-up in mind to maximize the carriers time and reduce delays. Sometimes carriers are told to leave within 15-30 minutes with or without the load. Having a good system in place will put both parties ahead.

### **Choose a carrier that covers your shipping region**

If you plan to ship far, make sure that the carrier reaches out to the destination. Some carriers will pass off your freight if they donâ€™t cover the region. This is costly and increases time in transit. GoShip.com will help you save time and money, and improve your LTL efficiency.
