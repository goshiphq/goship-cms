What is inside delivery?
------------------------

Inside delivery is when a shipment is delivered directly to the door of your residence or commercial facility. It is a service that is commonly offered by shipping companies like doorstep delivery services or white glove services for an additional fee. There are two main types of inside delivery: residential and commercial. Inside pickup and delivery are considered additional services, and inside delivery is an important part of last-mile logistics.

When do you need inside delivery?
---------------------------------

If you order something online, chances are you want the parcel right in front of your door. When you [ship something bulky](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/large-item-shipping/), it becomes even more crucial. It is a very common add-on service that many carriers offer. The thing is, when it comes to freight shipping, carriers have many limitations in terms of delivery. Usually, a shipment is delivered to a facility or a dock and is rarely dropped right in front of residential or commercial property. That’s where additional services come in handy. If you came home to see the shipment left sitting on the curb outside far from the door, you have secretly dreamed about this service. With the [increase in e-commerce](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/), the service has grown in popularity. For an additional fee, your carrier can deliver your shipment to your residence or building. Of course, drivers don't have a right to enter the building, so the place right in front of your door is a limit for this service. Usually, carriers leave it in places such as your front door, near the steps, or even by the garage door.

What are the types of inside delivery?
--------------------------------------

### Residential delivery

Why don’t they bring it inside my house for residential delivery? Many carriers have strict policies that prohibit drivers from an in-home delivery or pick-up. These policies are preventing any case of liability to damage inside the home (i.e. tracked in mud, damaged walls or doors, etc.) or issues involving an accident or injury. Basically, it is in everyone’s best interest that this is in place.

### Commercial delivery

For [businesses](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/small-business-shipping/), the rules are slightly different, but the policies remain the same. The carrier will only bring the load a few feet inside the main entrance, and no further. If it exceeds the limitations, there will be an increase in the delivery charges. Delivering freight up winding stairways or driveways are considered “extraordinary” functions and will not be performed.

How much does an inside delivery cost?
--------------------------------------

Inside delivery is an additional service in LTL freight shipping, and each carrier will individually determine the charge for these services. Before arranging an inside delivery, clearly communicate it with your carrier and state accurate location details to receive the most decent pricing.
