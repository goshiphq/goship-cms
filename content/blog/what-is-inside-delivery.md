## What is inside freight delivery?

Inside delivery occurs when a shipment is delivered directly to the door of your residence or commercial facility. It is a service that is commonly offered by shipping companies for an additional fee. Often, the delivery sites are not equipped with docks needed for successful loading and unloading, so you can take care of these operations by applying inside pickup or delivery.

These kinds of assistance are typically offered by doorstep delivery services or white glove services for an additional fee. Inside pickup and delivery are considered additional charges, and form an important part of [last-mile logistics](https://www.goship.com/posts/last-mile-delivery-improve-service).

## When do you need inside delivery?

When you make an expensive purchase online or buy [fragile items](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-ship-fragile-items), you'll probably want to receive the order right in front of your door. If you ship something bulky, secure delivery becomes even more crucial. When it comes to completing the freight shipping process, carriers often have many limitations during delivery. Usually, a shipment is moved to a facility or a dock and is rarely dropped in front of residential or commercial property. That’s where additional services come in handy. 

With the considerable [increase in e-commerce](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/), inside pickup and delivery services have grown in popularity. For an additional fee, the carrier can deliver your shipment to your residence or building. Of course, drivers are not allowed to enter the building, so the place right in front of your door is a limit for this service. As a rule, carriers leave parcels or boxes in places such as your front door, near the stairs, or even by the garage door.

## What are the types of inside delivery?

There are two main types of inside delivery: residential and commercial. The difference between them depends on the facility your freight needs to be delivered to.

### Residential delivery

Many carriers have strict policies that prohibit drivers from in-home delivery or pickup. These policies are preventing any case of liability to damage inside the home (i.e. tracked in mud, damaged walls or doors, etc.) or issues involving an accident or injury.

### Commercial delivery

For [businesses](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/small-business-shipping/), the rules are slightly different, but the policies remain the same. The carrier will only bring the load a few feet inside the main entrance, and no further. If it exceeds the limitations, there will be an increase in the delivery charges. Delivering freight up winding stairways or driveways are considered “extraordinary” functions and will not be performed.

## How much does an inside delivery cost?

Inside delivery is an additional service in LTL freight shipping, and each carrier will individually determine the charge for these services. Before arranging an inside delivery, clearly communicate it with your carrier and state accurate location details to receive the most decent pricing.
