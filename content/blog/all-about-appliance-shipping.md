Whether you are planning to move-out or ship appliances to customers, transporting household items can be challenging. The bulky size and complex structure makes shipping fridges, washing machines and ovens slightly different from furniture and other home items. If you plan to ship appliances, [GoShip.com](https://www.goship.com/) provides the LTL solution that will make transportation smooth and easy for you. When dealing with customers or personal use, it is important to make sure the items are shipped in the same condition they were in before transit. Here are some useful tips to help prepare you before getting a quote:

*   Make sure all the appliances are clean before you ship them. It is essential to empty and clean up all household machinery and items before moving.
*   Refrigerators must be defrosted at least 24 hours ahead of time before you ship them.
*   All items that have the water connection, like dishwashers, must be disconnected and double-checked before shipping.
*   All shelves, stray items, and any removable parts must be removed and packed separately. As for ovens, don’t forget to remove all the racks, knobs and grills and assure they’re packed separately.
*   Appliances with doors should be taped to assure the door doesn’t open while moving.
*   Use the proper packing materials to protect sensitive surfaces, such as stainless steel. Make sure to provide proper taping, foam and other materials on the appliances as well for added protection.
*   Label every box and put the label protection for every appliance with a shipping destination. Boxes with details and contents should be labeled as well.
*   If you have any questions about or during the shipping process, reach out to your shipping provider and ask them anything that you need. This will help you avoid confusion and identify if the service matches your needs.
