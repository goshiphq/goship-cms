As spring quickly approaches, so does the annual International Roadcheck, and it’s time to start preparations for this event. Every year, the [Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA)](https://www.cvsa.org/programs/international-roadcheck/) manages an international roadcheck where certified inspectors check carriers’ and drivers’ compliance, enforcement, educational initiatives, and vehicle safety. This year, the roadcheck will take place over three days on May 4-6, 2021.

## What is an International Roadcheck?

Starting on May 4th, inspectors all over North America will execute numerous road inspections to define the violations and equipment malfunctions according to the North American Standard Level I Inspection. Each year, thousands of drivers and carriers are placed out of service because of the blitz. Also, every year, CVSA keeps its focus on a certain category of violations. 

In 2021, the theme of inspection is lighting for vehicles and drivers’ hours of service (HOS). Last year, the focus was around driver violations; two years ago, it was steering and suspension systems. Invalid lighting accounted for about 12% of all vehicle violations discovered in 2020.

More than [15,000 drivers were put](https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/14940203/brake-violations-top-roadcheck-out-of-service-conditions) out of service. Inspectors will also be watching for critical vehicle inspection item violations described in the North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria. If they detect such in compliance, the vehicle will be placed out of service, which means that the vehicle cannot be operated until the identified out-of-service conditions have been changed. 

As part of the annual International Road check, inspectors will ensure the vehicle’s brake systems, cargo securement, coupling devices, driveline components, driver’s seat, exhaust systems, frames, fuel systems, lighting devices, steering mechanisms, suspensions, tires, van, and open-top trailer bodies, wheels, rims, hubs, and windshield wipers are compliant with regulations.

## What does an annual International Roadcheck mean to shippers?

For the shipping industry and shippers, in particular, these inspection days can cause shipment delays. To avoid it, choose carriers and shipping providers with robust tracking capabilities, plan in advance, or use expedited services if your freight needs urgent delivery.
