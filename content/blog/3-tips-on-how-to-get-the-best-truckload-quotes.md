Many different factors [affect truckload rates](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-are-truckload-freight-rates-calculated/) like shipment volume, mileage, lane, seasonality, carrier, etc. It’s also crucial to understand the different [types of rates](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-are-the-different-types-of-freight-rates/): spot and contract rates.  Once you've familiarized yourself with the basics, you'll be able to spot a competitive rate from an outrageous one.

### 2. Know your shipment

Knowing how what you're trying to ship factors into the shipping rate is a crucial part of shipping efficiency. Rates can vary wildly, not only because of what is being shipped, but also because of the mileage, destination, lane, current market capacity, and [seasonality](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-are-the-four-freight-shipping-seasons/) of the shipment. If you're able to figure those details out ahead of time, you can prepare yourself for the quoting process.
