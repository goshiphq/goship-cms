In this article, learn about the four types of small business resources. We'll give you a brief overview of how you can manage these resources to scale your business.



## What is a business resource?

Simply put, business resources are an organization's inputs' or 'assets' used to produce an outcome, whether it's a product or service.

Assets can either be tangible or intangible. Tangible assets include finances, human assets, equipment, real estate, tools, and machinery. Intangible assets include technology, patents, partnerships, databases, software, skills, culture, and expertise.

Businesses need to build strategies to manage and balance available resources to achieve an objective.

Business resources are considered valuable if they ensure a better customer experience than competitors. Availability, depreciation, and appropriability also make resources more valuable for a business.

### Why are business resources important?

Businesses, of course, need assets and resources to produce an output. Business resources are considered the "basic building blocks" of a company. Having a clear picture of your business resources will give you an overview of all the processes that make up your operations. This will help you optimize planning and management strategies to build your brands.



## What is the difference between a Small and Large Business?

Compared to large businesses, [a small business](https://asq.org/quality-resources/small-business) is privately-owned, a sole proprietorship, or a partnership. Generally, small businesses have fewer human resources, fewer financial assets, and less annual revenue.

To give you a better idea, these are the key differences between small vs. large businesses:

* **Structure:** Large businesses have a more rigid hierarchical structure and job profiles. Meanwhile, small businesses have a more flexible environment that allows employees to engage in decision-making.
* **Salary:** Larger companies often offer higher salaries. However, some small employers try to balance the discrepancy by providing substantive benefits.
* **Employees:** Micro-enterprises have fewer than ten employees, while small enterprises have between 10 to 50 employees. Large companies have at least 250 employees.
* **Culture:** Compared to small businesses, large businesses tend to be more conservative when it comes to risk-taking. Meanwhile, large companies also tend to have a standardized and regulated employee culture. Small businesses often have a diverse workforce that encourages change and growth.

Intangible assets include copyrights, partnerships, patents, brands, intellectual properties, customer knowledge, product reputation, customer service reputation, brand reputation, and technologies that make business operations easier and more streamlined.
