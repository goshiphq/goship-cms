Different commodities are categorized according to freight class, affecting your shipping rates. We will go over the basics of freight class, their types, and why it’s essential for shipments. 



# What is LTL freight class? 



LTL freight classes categorize commodities transported through LTL freight shipping by their characteristics. A numeric classification system, defined by the [National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA)](http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc), represents 18 different freight classes ranging from Class 50 to Class 500. 

It’s vital to know the critical features of your cargo to determine your freight class and get an LTL quote. It primarily concerns the freight nature, so make sure to understand what you’re going to ship and what type of products the cargo includes. Equally, verify you know the exact weight of your goods to see what freight class fits them.



## Why is freight class important? 



Modern freight class organization is the optimal way to calculate LTL shipping costs correctly. To get an accurate less-than-truckload quote, you will need to find your cargo’s freight class in the first place. In [LTL shipping](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-less-than-truckload-shipping-and-how-can-it-benefit-you), carriers load and unload cargo multiple times. The shipping services transport different freight in the same trailer as your pallets. LTL carriers need an idea of each pallet’s specifics: dimensions, weight, packaging, durability/fragility, and whether or not they can stack other items on top. 

The freight class helps carriers determine how efficient moving a particular shipment is. In short, by figuring out how much effort the LTL freight transportation requires, carrier services can quote how much your shipment will cost.



## How to calculate freight class? 



LTL carriers will often reweigh your cargo based on the space it takes in a trailer. Getting your freight class wrong means that you will have to pay more or less than you’re anticipating. You first need to determine the correct freight class your commodity suits to get an accurate quote. 

You need to know that high-density items have a lower freight class. Low-density items have a higher freight class. The lowest freight class (class 50) has the lowest price per pound. Denser items (class 500) are the most expensive.

NMFC classification relies on four main factors:



### 1. Density

Density refers to the weight per cubic foot per piece. It is the amount of space an item occupies. Freight with a higher density falls under a lower freight class because they’re more compact and easier to ship. Higher-density cargo is also cheaper to deliver.

Besides, [density identification](https://www.goship.com/posts/density-affect-ltl-shipping) means a lot for LTL carriers. If your shipment travels long-distance, shipping services will depend more on the freight density when regulating transportation prices. Imprecise density measurements can result in wasted truck space and thus increase your shipping costs.



### 2. Stowability

This factor refers to how easily a commodity can be loaded and transported with other goods. These freight types are more sensitive to external factors and usually require extra space to prevent them from contacting other shipped products for safety purposes. For example, if you’re shipping goods containing chemicals, the additional pressure can cause dangerous effects and logistics disruptions. Equally, carriers need to properly place the items of unusual shape to avoid their destruction. 

Factors that make freight difficult to stow are:

* Unusual and oddly shaped dimensions.
* Hazardous goods.
* Flammable.
* Perishable.
* Very heavy.



### 3. Handling

Handling refers to any special care or attention needed to transport your cargo. [Fragile items](https://www.goship.com/posts/5-tips-shipping-fragile-items) will fall into a higher freight class and cost more to ship. The carrier will have to manipulate breakable things in a way they don’t lose their shape and structure.

[Hazmats](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-ship-hazardous-materials-a-guide-to-hazmat-shipping) also require special handling, and it’s vital to verify the carrier knows how to behave with them not to provoke any chemical reactions. While some hazmats are relatively safe and you can easily stack them in regular crates, other toxic substances need careful handling and minimized risks of their unpacking.

Size, shape, and weight also affect the ease of handling. Heavy and [oversized items](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/large-item-shipping) often demand special equipment to perform complicated loading/unloading operations.



### 4. Liability

Liability covers the likelihood of freight damage, theft, loss, or damage to other loads. If an item is hazardous, explosive, or perishable, it will have a higher liability rating and higher freight class. If shipping these freight types, try to get sufficient carrier liability or full [freight insurance](https://www.goship.com/resources/freight-insurance) to avoid significant financial losses.
