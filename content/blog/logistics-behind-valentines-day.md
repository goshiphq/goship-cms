Valentine’s Day is upon us and it’s no secret that this holiday is most popular for florists. Not many people take the time to think about the effort put into the supply chain that pulls this whole day off. US consumers purchase the most flowers on Valentine’s Day than any other day of the year, roses being the number one choice. It takes a lot to get those roses market ready, and like all perishable products, they need extra attention. All flowers are considered perishable and require specific temperatures in order to keep them fresh upon arrival to their destinations. Without a maintained temperature, the flowers could lose their bloom. Shippers make the use of refrigerated trucks when moving these types of items, they have the ability to regulate the temperature inside of the trailer. In between movement, the flowers are kept in a temperature controlled warehouse. See the key word here? The rose in particular, is commonly brought into the US from Latin America where they are able to grow them year-round for the mass amount needed for Valentine’s Day. Based upon past results, an average of 198 million roses are produced each year for this day. Think about that the next time you walk through a store… You can find roses in your local gas station, supermarket, big box store and even at street corners, and that’s just to name a few. These flowers undergo a long journey from Latin America. After making the journey to the US, they have a long way to go from Miami, where they go through customs. As mentioned earlier, the roses are placed into temperature controlled warehouses and eventually transferred onto trucks that have a refrigerated trailer attached. These trucks make the long haul across the country to many distribution centers that direct the roses to their final destination before being purchased. The time it takes is around 10 days before the roses reach the store they are to be sold at. These roses make the long journey so consumers don’t have to. 10 days of travel and care to ensure that each rose arrives as fresh as possible. The florist is now ready to prepare bouquets and consumers are able to pick the perfect rose(s) for their special someone. Logistics don’t just stop at the stores though; these flowers are being sent to many homes across the country from retailers.
