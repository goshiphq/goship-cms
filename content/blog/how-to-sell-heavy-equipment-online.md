## How to sell heavy equipment online

### Cleaning your equipment

Sometimes shippers forget about the basic rule of cleaning or refurbishing your equipment before posting it anywhere. This will not only make your offer more attractive, but will show potential buyers that you care about the items, and about the next owners. Make sure to do any necessary cleaning and restoring before taking pictures.

### Pictures and information

To sell something online, you have to make it stand out. Most customers won’t be able to come and inspect equipment in person. That’s why taking detailed, high-resolution pictures is a must. Take photos of your heavy items from all angles with good lighting and resolution. It is important to take photos of details and any accessory items that go with the main shipment. Remember to be honest when taking photos. 

You are selling used equipment, and it is a bad idea to make it seem as if it’s brand new. If your goods have any scratches or visible damages, include those pictures as well. This will present you as an honest seller and will help avoid further claims. Once you are done with photos, proceed to fill in the description. It has to be clear, concise, and contain all the required information. Apart from the basic info, make sure to include your equipment’s history, including repairs or damages.

### Choosing a platform for selling

Last but not least is choosing the right marketplace for selling your heavy equipment online. The best way is to target multiple selling channels is in the form of [specialized niche services](https://www.equipmenttrader.com/) or post directly to widely-known platforms like Craigslist or eBay. You can even post your heavy equipment in special Facebook groups to reach more potential buyers. 

But when placing your offer on different platforms, remember to look out for common scams and vet your buyers. If you’re looking for advanced ways to push your sales, the best way is to run an ad or invest in learning and executing search engine optimization (SEO). These techniques can significantly increase the pool of potential buyers and speed up the selling process.
