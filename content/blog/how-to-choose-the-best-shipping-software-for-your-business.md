Whether you own a small eCommerce shop or a fast-growing enterprise, you will need shipping software that’ll set your business up for success. Taking the responsibility to streamline your workflow with new technology can be daunting, but it’s the first step to ensuring that you find the right solutions that will usher your business into the future. Finding a dedicated shipping software will allow you to easily handle order fulfillment on a single platform. With that, we’re excited to give you a glimpse of how you can find the best shipping solutions for your business.

## Why do I need Shipping Software?

With the boom of the eCommerce industry, businesses need to take a serious look at how efficient their workflows are. Most businesses will spend an inefficient amount of time and energy on streamlining their shipping process. This takes away practical resources that you could allocate to customer support or product development instead.

The best shipping software helps business owners to:

- Manage large orders from multiple stores on a single platform
- Increase order volume and carrier capacity
- Take advantage of shipping discounts with different carriers

Ultimately, businesses that incorporate shipping software can streamline their entire shipping process. And we all know what that means, happy customers and better business prospects!

## What to Consider when Evaluating Shipping Software

It’s important to keep in mind, though, that businesses of different sizes will have different needs. Small to medium businesses in the early stages of growth might need more structured software with defined workflows. High-volume merchants and warehouses with complex workflows will need highly customizable and flexible shipping software to match and enhance their current systems.

Another thing to consider is security ad speed. Some methods to consider are cloud-only solutions vs on-site solutions. The first choice offers the benefit of convenience, but the latter allows businesses to maximize workflows and increase daily capacity.

Choosing your software solutions can be overwhelming. Thankfully, there is hybrid shipping software that offers scalability, speed, and security through a healthy mix of cloud-based and on-site features.

While businesses will have unique needs, there are some minimum features and integrations you should look for to find the best shipping software:

### Integrations

Make sure that you go with shipping software that is compatible with your current and potential system, carriers, and channels. You should note that some shipping software limits its integrations to a small group of partners or a particular subset of the market. The smartest choice will be to go with shipping software with a wide selection of built-in integrations, while also allowing you to connect with any system or carrier.

Some of the most useful integration tools that can help manage your business are:

- Carrier integration
- Label printing
- Order Management System
- Bookkeeping
- Express orders

### Features to Look For

To automate and simplify your shipping process, look for features such as:

- Custom forms generator
- Spreadsheet import
- Manual orders
- Batch shipping
- Tax calculators
- Cost management
- Quote comparisons and rate calculators
- Return

Another important feature that will save your business, in the long run, is tracking and customer service.
