Managing every aspect of your business can be more rewarding without having to share any of your profits or glory in the process. However, hiring employees to work for and with you can decrease your stress levels and decompress your workload. With the proper screening of those you hire, there’s no telling what heights you can reach as a team instead of alone.

Here, we will discuss what you need to know about hiring employees for a small business, its pros and cons, tips on how to go about it, and what programs can be of service to you and your business. 

## Hiring for a small business: what kind of help do you need?

If you are already thinking of hiring people to work for you, ensure you hire the right ones. Specify what positions you need filling and what different skillsets they require. 

Remember, this is your business, and you can come up with your own requirements in discerning an applicant’s qualifications.  

### Small business hiring process

You must specify what skills you are looking for and stick to your standards. You are enlisting professionals to catapult your business’ success forward. 

Hire professionals with the right qualifications who adhere to the standards you set for your products and services. Build your team with your long-term goals in mind. Think of who can help make your business work more efficiently. 

Besides putting up posters and online ads, there are other helpful tools you can use in seeking these individuals: 

#### Social media announcements

Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, or even Snapchat can help you get the word out. You can post on either your professional or personal account that you are hiring. 

One way to catch anyone’s attention is to post a picture comprising the positions you have open and what qualifications are required. Remember to include details on the post such as what your business is about, where to contact you, where to send in applications, and any benefits you are providing. 

We don’t suggest including how much you are paying, as people sometimes make snap judgments based on this. If the pay is high, unqualified individuals might reach out anyway. If the pay is too low, it might deter qualified others.  

#### TaskRabbit

If you aren’t prepared to commit to onboarding an employee full-time and need immediate assistance, check out [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/). 

The mobile marketplace helps connect you to someone reliable that can assist you with whatever you need at the moment. You can hire someone part-time online, but TaskRabbit helps generate a *contract* for one-off tasks you assign. 

People who work for TaskRabbit have diverse expertise ranging from moving, building, cleaning, delivering, repairing, food prepping, filming, technicians, administrative assistants, and more.

#### GoShip.com

In case you only need logistical assistance, [GoShip.com](https://www.goship.com/) is a complete self-service platform for small to mid-scale businesses. GoShip helps anyone with freight shipping needs. 

One of the biggest challenges small businesses face is logistics, especially with larger loads. If the volume of your deliveries increases or your network expands, you can reach out to GoShip.com to choose between their less-than-truckload (LTL) and full-truckload (FTL) shipping services. 

They offer [instant quotations](https://quotes.goship.com/booking/request-quote) services online 24/7. 

## What is the opportunity of not hiring?

Understandably, as a small business, you might not have the resources to onboard employees. With restricted resources, maybe the most efficient thing you can do for your business is manage everything alone. 

We can see the rise of self-managed businesses given the pandemic and the spike in e-commerce it brought. These days, more product-centric businesses are run solo out of someone’s house. 

Not hiring employees allows business owners to rake in profit for themselves without a fraction of it going into payroll. Running a business solo means you pay off individual services and keep all the revenue for yourself. You can dedicate a portion of your earnings or any residuals to growing your business in the future. 

It’s risky to hire employees before your business earns a marginal profit. You might dig yourself into a hole by paying salaries your business can’t afford yet. 

The opportunity to learn the business from top to bottom is most important here. By doing everything yourself first, you’ll have the know-how for later on when you delegate them to others. 

Keep in mind it is your job to manage and track deliveries. Different sites serve as platforms for small businesses, but you can also create your own website. Managing your own website allows for greater control but can be a heavy workload on top of managing your new business. Make sure you are well-equipped with the knowledge and drive this feat will require.

At this point, you may not need to hire permanent employees and can stick to hiring one-off and logistical services. However, if you choose to manage everything yourself, make sure you are up to the task. 

### Can you clearly define the role?

Ensure you study everything you need to run your business. If you sell specific items, make sure you know everything about them. You will also need to answer all customer queries and make yourself available to respond to each customer. 

If you don’t know too much about e-commerce, websites, logistics, and other components of running a business, dedicate some time to learn them online. Research what roles you need to fill and what skills you need to learn to define them yourself. 

If you are your only employee at the moment, you better be one that you can count on for everything. 

### Hiring services are more efficient for small and start-up business

With fewer resources to go around, you’re better off hiring one-off services to assist you along the way. Build your business first to expand its reach, and when it’s booming, you can start expansion on your team next. 

#### Where to go for help

Instead of employing someone to work for you full-time with fixed salaries or bi-monthly payouts, do what you can solo. Hire logistical services with affordable rates at [GoShip.com](https://www.goship.com/) or hire someone to assist you temporarily through [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/). 

You can’t afford to pick up after sloppy shipments. Entrust your product’s shipment to a reliable and well-respected delivery partner. After all, the overall delivery of the goods will also reflect on your business and not the carrier. 

**[GoShip ](https://www.goship.com/)has over forty-two thousand certified carriers available at affordable rates!**
