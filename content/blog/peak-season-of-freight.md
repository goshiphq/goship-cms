Fall – a time where students go back to school, leaves begin to fall and temperatures start to drop as the holiday season rapidly approaches. In the shipping industry, the fall is a time where shipments start to pick up as freight enters into its peak season. From the end of summer, all the way to October is known to be the peak season of freight as businesses participate in sales and consumers begin to plan for the holiday season. It is important for businesses to stay on top of their game during this time of year to survive the peak freight season where truck demand is high and capacity is tight. We have put together a few tips to help you survive the peak freight season this year.

**Stay ahead of your shipments**
--------------------------------

Be proactive about your shipments and create a plan to follow if something goes wrong. Whenever you are shipping your items, you should provide as much lead time as possible. The more lead time you provide, the more cost-effective your shipment can be. Ship your items in advance and give your shipment plenty of time to get to its destination to give your company an advantage against other companies that are scrambling to get their shipments out.

**Do your research**
--------------------

Stay up to date on daily, monthly and annual freight indexes to understand different market fluctuations and pricing trends. Peak season is a time where rates increase and fees are common. Being aware of what the different trends are in the industry will help you stay ahead and find the best option for your shipments.

**Be flexible**
---------------

If shippers have strict, narrow delivery times, this can cause problems for carriers and increase the amount of dwell time waiting for gates to open to make the delivery. Consider nights or weekend deliveries for your shipments so that more drivers are available and loading docks are less congested.
