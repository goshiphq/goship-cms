It has never been easier to sell and buy things online or ship items internationally. Whether you’re an individual entrepreneur or a small business owner, you can benefit from the rapid development of [cross-border e-commerce](https://www.goship.com/blog/cross-border-e-commerce-everything-you-need-to-know/). Numerous marketplaces made it possible to access customers across the world. For example, [shipping to Canada](https://www.goship.com/blog/shipping-to-canada-from-the-us/) can be a great start for U.S. retailers or businesses.  While it has become easier to expand your audiences and handle transactions from different countries, shipping freight internationally can still be a challenge.

# How to Ship Internationally: Principles of International Shipping

International shipping is moving shipments between different countries via various transportation modes: trucking, ocean, or road. The main complexity of shipping freight internationally is the customs clearance process. It is important to consider all the intricacies of import and export rules and regulations of a certain country, as well as [taxes](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html), duties, etc. If you’re shipping a parcel, you would typically go to the parcel shipping service and just pay for delivery. But if you need to ship a large volume of goods or freight, the process becomes more complicated. Usually, shippers turn to freight forwarding companies or work with a customs broker to arrange their shipment.

## Types of International Freight Shipping

The type of your international shipping is determined by the transport means you choose to complete the delivery. While **air freight transportation** is fast and effective, **ocean freight shipping** is more suitable for moving [large items](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/large-item-shipping). If you are only starting to ship internationally, it is recommended to use **ground freight transportation** due to its high accessibility and cost-efficiency.

Ground freight transportation offers you two main shipping modes the choice of which depends on your cargo size and expected delivery time.

* [Less than truckload](https://www.goship.com/posts/ltl-freight-shipping-for-beginners) shipping mode (LTL) is a perfect option for small shipments that don't require the whole trailer's space. You'll share the truck with several individuals and thus saving shipping costs.
* [Full truckload](https://www.goship.com/posts/when-should-you-switch-to-full-truckload-shipping) shipping mode (FTL) suits large shipments that are both time-sensitive and have high load safety requirements.

## How to Organize International Freight Shipping?

When planning your international shipments, make sure to follow principal preparation steps.

### Information

Although you might be working with customs brokerage services, it is your primary responsibility to collect and provide [accurate information](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-measure-your-freight-shipment-properly/) about your shipment. Weight, dimensions, value, classes, [possible restrictions](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-an-embargo-in-freight-shipping), or anything that is needed for transportation and customs clearance must be correct.

Since international freight shipping requires more time for preparations and planning all the necessary operations, it is recommended to complete demand forecasting. You can do it by analyzing your income over certain periods. If you are actively selling your products online, demand forecasting can be held with the help of various marketing tools like collecting feedback, etc. These actions will allow you to start your international shipping with the most popular products.

### Customs broker

A good professional will know all the nuances involved in the process and will save you time and money. From collecting required paperwork and filling out numerous customs forms, to actually handling the customs clearance, a customs broker will be your key guide in the global shipping process and inform you about all the duties and taxes you may face. Usually, businesses use freight forwarding companies, but some international shipping services offer customs brokers on their side to make it easier for the shippers.
