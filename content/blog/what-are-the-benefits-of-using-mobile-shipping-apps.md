Over the last decade, the logistics and transportation industry have been greatly reshaped by technology. In many ways, technological advances have changed operations, data storage, tracking, customer service, and many other sectors of shipping. With more logistics start-ups emerging, the market becomes more saturated with new software and tech solutions for full truckload and less than truckload shipping. Shipping apps represent one of the most convenient and useful tools for business owners of all scales. [Shipping applications](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-shipping-app/) provide many benefits to anyone involved in the freight shipping process, as it makes it faster, simpler, and easier to monitor. Mobile solutions are the best way to track and oversee processes in real-time and get notified about any shipment updates.

## How do shipping apps work?

Modern shipping apps are designed to significantly facilitate your logistics process. Once you set up your profile and fill out the necessary information, you'll be able to get an instant quote and compare the actual shipping rates. Using mobile shipping apps gives you a quick insight to supply chain pricing and provides access to a big number of carriers ready to pick up your load. 

While using mobile shipping apps, you will be able to enter the pickup and delivery locations, desirable dates, and select a suitable shipping mode based on your load type. If you are planning to move a shipment of moderate size, it is recommended to choose [less than truckload](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping) option, and, vice versa, [full truckload](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping) for large shipments. Then, it will take you a few clicks to book a shipment tailored to your criteria, and start your transit operations right away. 

In course of shipment, you'll be getting updated on the load location and status, so there is no possibility of losing your cargo out of sight. Eventually, you will receive a notification when your shipment has arrived at the destination point and delivery has been completed.

## Why should you use mobile shipping apps?

### Save time

The core advantage of getting a shipping app is its speed and ability to manage everything when you need it. Having the entire functionality of [shipping software](https://www.goship.com/blog/benefits-of-using-an-online-shipping-service/), you can book, modify, monitor, and update all the processes within a few clicks and not rely on talking to a freight broker. Apps also give you access to real-time data, which lets you immediately see a delay or any other [disruption](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-deal-with-supply-chain-disruptions) that may arise. Some shipping apps also provide data you can save or store for analytics purposes. With the automation and convenience that mobile shipping apps provide, you save tons of time usually needed for unnecessary operations.

### Transparent pricing

When using an online freight shipping company's app, you can [compare freight quotes](https://www.goship.com/) from different carriers in real-time instead of talking to several freight brokers and waiting for updates. All you need to do is enter accurate information about your shipment and destination to see available carriers to move your items. Once you find the [price you like](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-are-the-different-types-of-freight-rates/), you just proceed to book or clarify some additional shipping details directly with the carrier.

### Load management and optimization

Thanks to data storage, you can easily use all the historical information to analyze and enhance operational performance. You can identify supply chain gaps or inconsistencies, and make adjustments to optimize the process. Mobile shipping apps let you review load management and planning, as well as forecasting potential mistakes. Also, you can get advanced reports and updates on your shipments, which reduces the number of manual operations even more.
