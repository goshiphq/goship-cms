Shipping large objects and equipment is always a challenge. Shipping a vehicle is no exception. Whether you are [selling a vehicle](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-sell-heavy-equipment-online/) or a heavy piece of equipment, you'll need to be prepared with a successful shipping strategy. While shipping a vehicle across the country can be quite costly, you can find a more reasonable price by taking the [right steps](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-does-the-shipping-of-automotive-parts-work/).

1\. How much does it cost to ship a vehicle across the country?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The price of shipping a vehicle has a very wide range, varying between $300 and $1500. Price depends on the destination, shipping type, season, etc. If you need to ship an object from Florida to California, it will certainly be much more expensive than shipping to a neighboring state. To best determine the cost, you should find out your vehicle’s dimensions and the pick-up and delivery addresses.

2\. How can I ship a vehicle across the country?
------------------------------------------------

There are two key types of transportation for vehicles: open and closed transportation. The key difference between these two types of transport is that the objects in an open truck are not protected from the external influences like weather or, for instance, a stone or a bird smashing into the vehicle. For this type of transportation, you will likely need better insurance. For the fall and winter seasons, it’s better to use closed transportation. Also, keep in mind that the truck won’t be entirely dedicated to your vehicle, otherwise, it would be rather expensive. On the same token, shipping to remote destinations can take from 5 to 14 days, because the driver will drop other vehicles off along the way.
