What is eCommerce shipping? 
----------------------------

eCommerce shipping is more than fast delivery and free shipping. It encompasses all the services from marketing your product down to delivery and fulfillment, and everything in between.  The most successful online merchants use strategic eCommerce shipping strategies to set themselves apart from the competition and increase margins.

What does eCommerce involve? 
-----------------------------

The eCommerce shipping process begins when your customer clicks that “add to cart” button, and it ends just after the parcel arrives on their doorstep. 

### Step 1: Order Received

As soon as a customer makes a purchase, your team needs to check inventory and make sure that the item is in stock.

### Step 2: Order Processing

Now it is time to verify client data and information to ship the right product to the correct address.

### Step 3: Order Fulfillment

As soon as a picklist (includes information on product SKUs, inventory, and location) is generated, items will be picked, packed, and prepared for shipment.

How do I proceed with eCommerce Shipping?
-----------------------------------------

### 1\. Assemble the right team team

Identify the right people to make up every department in relation to shipping your products. In general, your organization should include: **Marketing team** This team is in charge of attracting clients to your store with shipping promotions like free shipping or flat rate to encourage sales. **Web design and development team** This team communicates accurate and clear shipping options and information on your online store through a user-friendly platform. **Fulfillment team** This team ensures that orders are picked, packed, and shipped accurately and on time, whatever the product and location of the customer. **Customer service team** They are in charge of supporting customers throughout the sales lifecycle by providing the answers to concerns, exchanges, and refunds.

### 2\. Set clear goals

Define the goals that you want to accomplish with your shipping strategy. Some common eCommerce shipping goals include

*   Increasing average order value from promotions 
*   Increasing conversions
*   Expanding your market to include international shipping or alternative shipping options
*   Decreasing costs with a real-time rate calculator or shipping partner
*   Improved operational efficiency and automation for better decision-making

### 3\. Establish your shipping strategy

Once you’ve assembled your team and the goals for your e-commerce shipment, it is time to choose a shipping strategy that will work for your team and the goals you have set. Here are the top considerations to come up with your shipping strategy: **Product size and weight** Gather the dimensions of all the products on your online store. If your products do not differ much in size or weight, you can go with a location-based approach to calculating shipping costs. Otherwise, break down your products into categories depending on their size or weight, and assign a shipping cost. **Shipping destinations** For domestic shipping, a simple flat-rate or free shipping option is attractive for customers. For a more comprehensive approach, you can go with zone-based pricing. International shipping will be more difficult to quote. We suggest getting in touch with a logistics operation provider to get professional assistance on how to navigate paperwork, ensure compliance with trade laws, and get an accurate [shipping quote](https://www.goship.com/). **Packaging** Presentation is an essential part of eCommerce shipping. It is the first time your customer will experience your package, so make sure to go above and beyond to impress your customers and exceed their expectations by delivering an experience, not just a physical product. **Shipping Options** While there are many [shipping options](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/) that you can choose from, we recommend going for total shipping eCommerce solutions.
