The spookiest night of the year is just around the corner!  The end of October is a prime time not only for witches and ghosts, but also for retailers. Shippers are getting ready to ship scary costumes, decorations, and of course, lots of treats. At the same time, retailers and shipping companies are preparing to supply the spooky occasion. Halloween shipping plays an enormous role in the retail industry.  The real goal of the retailer’s job is to deliver goods on-time, undamaged, and to the right place. Otherwise, nightmares happen. Boo! Traditionally, Halloween signifies the beginning of the holiday shopping season in America and around the world. The turnaround for the haunted night is getting bigger each year. In the U.S. alone, Halloween retail sales in 2019 reached $8.6 billion in revenue. However, this year, sales volumes are [expected to drop by 8%](https://www.thebalance.com/halloween-spending-statistics-facts-and-trends-3305716) because of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this setback, more than 148 million customers are Halloween shopping this year.

What do shippers buy on Halloween?
----------------------------------

Have you ever wondered what people buy and how much they really spend on Halloween? According to statistical reports, in 2020, 53% of Americans will acquire holiday decorations, 46% will carve pumpkins, and 18% will purchase costumes for their pets. The most popular costumes among adults are witches, vampires, zombies, pirates, and Avengers characters. For children, they are princesses, superheroes, witches, and Star Wars characters. One of the most surprising and growing trends among Halloween shoppers is buying a costume not just for their children or themselves, but for the pets, too.

How to prepare for Halloween shipping?
--------------------------------------

It’s extremely important for retailers to provide a positive customer experience for their customers. First and foremost, buyers want their items on-time. Wrapping and packaging play a crucial role in shipment protection as well. As for the entire holiday season, retailers should keep their inventories and warehouses organized in order to fulfill all orders on-time and successfully ship them across the country. While packaging matters for Halloween costumes and decorations, the most important part for companies who ship sweets and candies is that trucks need to have climate control to deliver goods in the proper condition.
