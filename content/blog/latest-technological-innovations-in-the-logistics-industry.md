The logistics industry is highly competitive and requires shippers to master their ways of goods transportation constantly. It creates new challenges for the supply chain management. Luckily, shipping companies can overcome many of these challenges with the help of emerging technological advancements.



# Why do we need technology in logistics?



The modern supply chain industry often involves tasks that traditional means cannot resolve. That is why technology steps into the game and brings new opportunities for developing better logistics strategies. Almost [80% of Americans](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273958/digital-buyer-penetration-in-the-united-states/) prefer to order goods online, implying active usage of digital resources. That means logistics should search for an appropriate technical response to satisfy growing customers' demands and meet high delivery expectations. 

Technological tools aid in shipment planning and organization by coming up with advanced mapping and [tracking](https://www.goship.com/posts/3-reasons-shipment-tracking-matters) ideas. Also, logistics digitalization can effectively reduce the risks of financial losses by excluding human errors. Finally, you can streamline your shipping operations at any stage of the supply chain.



## New advancements in shipping technology



Recent digital developments in logistics mainly target automating the shipping processes and simplifying transportation management for business owners. When planning to modernize your supply chain, learn more about the most beneficial technological solutions.



### Autonomous equipment



A few years ago, autonomous elements in logistics were available mainly for long-established and prosperous businesses. Now, shippers of all scales widely use automated equipment in their delivery organization. Automated logistics has become more affordable, and it doesn't boil down only to self-driven vehicles. You can apply this technology to any level of your supply chain. For example, you can consider directing numerous manual warehousing operations to **warehouse robotics systems**. It will improve your inventory management and eliminate the necessity to supervise regular warehouse chores. Or, you can try using automated devices to facilitate the process of cargo loading/unloading. Besides, many companies test **autonomous drones** for effective [last-mile delivery](https://www.goship.com/posts/last-mile-delivery-improve-service) to avoid frequent transportation issues. 



Automated technologies are equally helpful for completing **big data analytics**. Software managed by artificial intelligence (AI) attributes can quickly detect the flaws in logistics planning, budgeting, or demand forecasting. It significantly simplifies calculating procedures, eliminating costs inaccuracies.

### Digital routing

Optimization of the route and delivery time is an everlasting task for shippers. When trying to find better opportunities for easy transportation, shipping companies often apply digital routing. This tool allows you to pick the best mapping for your shipment, thus shortening its duration. Modern logistics software provides access to many available routes, highlighting the bottlenecks of every one of them and describing possible disruptions. Powered by the internet of things, **electronic route programs** collect all the data during transportation (speed, fuel waste, etc.) and report on required adjustments. 

Digital routing can help predict transit delays and change the road map. Besides, routing improves the last-mile efficiency. Instead of preliminary planning the last-mile delivery, digital routing schemes will develop final ideas based on the actual shipment flow. Moreover, you'll get the opportunity to overcome another logistics challenge - [visibility](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-supply-chain-visibility-and-why-is-it-important). Your buyers will track their orders comfortably and receive a better customer experience. 



### Sustainable fuels

Today, transportation companies are trying to implement various **fuel alternatives** for shipping operations. This trend is driven by the growing demand for sustainability and [eco-friendly transportation](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-shippers-can-support-green-shipping). Many businesses cannot replace their transport means with electric options. Thus, using alternative fuels is one of the most optimal ways to reduce emissions. Various types of sustainable fuels (SFs) are made of renewable substances or waste materials. They are safe for the environment and are compatible with different vehicles. 



Sustainable fuels are especially favorable for moving large items, typically done by ocean transport. Active shipping causes the release of numerous harmful matters both into the water and the atmosphere, which is highly dangerous for nature. Switching to ecological fuels can partially resolve the environmental issue and make the logistics process more cost-efficient.



### Cloud transportation systems



Relocating transportation management systems to cloud-based storage is another way to keep your supply chain up to date. Cloud shipping systems are available from any place and device, streamlining control operations and giving you instant access to required information. Additionally, you can upload data from several sources to your **cloud storage** and thus increase your shipping visibility. 

**Cloud computing** can save costs as you won't have to use too many hardware objects in your business. Instead, you can transfer collected data and analytics to a virtual space that is both highly scalable and accessible. Also, your virtual storage will be automatically applying all the recent technology updates and tailor them to your business needs. For instance, you may focus your cloud systems on budgeting, routing, or other aspects of the supply chain.

Thanks to smart logistics suggestions, it becomes possible to run any type of transit in a matter of a few clicks. At GoShip, we can help you schedule a shipment and get a quote using a single [online tool](https://www.goship.com/).
