It doesn’t matter if you are a manufacturer, retailer, or just moving across the country, furniture shipping can be a burden. Considering all the things you have to manage, it can indeed turn into a nightmare. Therefore, safe and convenient shipping is what you expect from a shipping service. If the pieces are too large, it may require additional packing and help of specialized services. If moving to a new place or shipping furniture is among your nearest plans, here are three main steps for safe shipping:

**MEASUREMENTS**
----------------

Before packing or choosing a service for transporting, you have to weigh and measure your furniture. If you want to ship your items through an online shipping service, they will require accurate measurements of the item you are shipping. If possible, disassemble the pieces for secure packing and transportation. Make sure that the information about the freight is accurate because these factors affect the final price of delivery.

**PACKING**
-----------

The next step to safe furniture shipping is proper packing. Depending on the item type, you want to make sure that your belongings will arrive at its destination undamaged. Pack fragile items with bubble wrap or cushioning materials. Additionally, use double boxes, rigid cardboard, and industrial tapes to help ensure the safety of your items. For larger items, you might need stronger protection for your shipment, such as pallets. Make sure that you [safely prepare your freight shipment](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-safely-prepare-your-ltl-freight-shipment/) on the pallet to avoid damages.
