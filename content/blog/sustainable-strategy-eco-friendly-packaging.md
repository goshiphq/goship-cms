They say that you should never judge a book by its cover. However, business owners are aware of how critical product packaging is to customer satisfaction. It is likely to be the first physical encounter your customers have with your brand and sets the tone for the customer’s perception of your brand. With the skyrocketing online shopping demands due to COVID-19, eye-catching plastic packaging waste has unfortunately become a serious environmental issue which has become a rising concern among consumers in recent years.   Fortunately, sustainable and eco-friendly packaging that is just as beneficial for Mother Earth as it is for your business, is becoming more accessible!  

What is eco-friendly packaging? 
--------------------------------

Put simply, eco-friendly packaging is sustainable for the environment and consumers. It is a form of _conscious packaging_ that is mostly made of renewable or recycled materials. What are the considerations for eco-friendly packaging? There is no universal definition for eco-friendly packaging which makes it challenging for businesses to migrate to 100% sustainable solutions.  Eco-friendly packaging will often vary between industries, but the most important considerations include:  

*   Producing little to zero environmental waste 
*   Made with recycled or biodegradable material 
*   Uses renewable energy during production 
*   Safe for the environment and consumers 
*   Efficient performance and cost-friendly 

What are the benefits of eco-friendly packaging?
------------------------------------------------

Over the years, [plastic packaging](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns) (including bubble wrap and packets) has helped businesses make deliveries more secure and efficient. However, did you know that it can take 1,000 years for plastic to break down completely? In a span of almost 70 years, not even [10% of the world’s plastic waste](https://ourworldindata.org/faq-on-plastics#how-much-of-global-plastic-is-recycled) was recycled.    Aside from the critical responsibility of businesses and eCommerce to address the plastic problem, here is how sustainable packaging can help the planet and your business:  

*   Biodegradable and recyclable packaging are easy to reuse and dispose of. 
*   Only use renewable, organic, and natural raw material for production. 
*   Sustainable packaging leads to a lower carbon footprint and less waste during production. 
*   The lack of synthetic materials is safe for people and the environment. 
*   Manufacturing costs of sustainable packaging are significantly less than regular plastic packaging. 
*   Green solutions improve the perception of your brand. 
*   Grow your client base with Millennials, Gen Z, and other eco-conscious individuals. 
*   Sustainable packaging is often sturdier and offers reliable protection of your items. 

Eco-friendly Shipping Ideas
---------------------------

Going green will require you to explore alternative options for packaging. Thankfully, there have been vast developments in sustainable packaging ideas in the past years: 

### Organic Materials and Bioplastics 

Organic materials, including cornstarch, cassava, seaweed, and mushroom roots can be used as sustainable packaging. These materials have properties that mimic plastic, although, unlike petroleum-based products, organic materials are biodegradable. More importantly, many of these organic materials are made with agricultural waste. 

### Plant fibers 

Cotton, tapioca, palm leaves, and jute aren’t only eco-friendly, they also allow businesses to create beautiful and reusable tote bags that customers will appreciate. More importantly, these will encourage your customers to start building on their own eco-conscious practices, too! 

### Eco-friendly Cushioning and Fillers 

Instead of using bubble wrap, Styrofoam, or EPS peanuts, try using eco-friendly alternatives such as upcycled corrugated cardboard, shredded paper, or air pillows made of recycled plastic. 

### Recycled Plastic and eco-friendly plastic 

Sometimes, some of your products will need extra support and protection that only plastic can provide. Fortunately, there are packaging and shipping materials that are made from 100% recycled plastic.  These include drums, spill control pallets, and spill trays.
