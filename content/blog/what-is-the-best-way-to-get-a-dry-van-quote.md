# What Is the Best Way to Get a Dry Van Quote Fast

Because of its versatility, dry van shipping is the most common way to send freight across state lines. 

Whether it’s a full truckload or less-than-truckload service, dry van shipping is an affordable and accessible way for shippers to send most types of goods.

However, calculating the costs of dry van quotes isn’t that easy – you have to consider various factors, such as location, freight description, and even trucking supply and demand to get an accurate quote.

Thankfully, there are [online freight shipping marketplaces](http://www.goship.com) available that give an instant quote. There’s no need to do any time-consuming calculations and market research.

## What Is a Dry Van Trailer?

Dry vans are standard non-temperature controlled trailers, measuring:

* Length: 48 to 53 feet
* Width: 8.5 feet
* Height: 13.5 feet

Standard dry van trailers can haul a total of 45,000 pounds.

Dry van freight is typically loaded in boxes or pallets or otherwise secured within the truck. Standard 53-foot dry van trailers carry 26 pallets.

Because of their versatility, [dry vans](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-dry-van-shipping) are ideal for almost all types of shipment of goods and equipment that meet size and weight limitations. 

### Full Truckload (FTL) Dry Van Shipping

FTL dry van shipments are hauled in a dedicated trailer. Although FTL means covering the costs of the entire trucking service, shippers get the advantage of on-time pickup and delivery.

### Less-than-Truckload (LTL) Dry Van Shipping

LTL shipments require only partial floor space, making it an efficient, energy-saving, and cost-effective alternative to FTL if you don’t have enough freight for a full truckload.

## What Are the Key Factors Behind Dry Van Quotes?

Shippers might have a difficult time getting dry van quotes – this is because rates fluctuate heavily throughout the year.

Planning around dry van rate fluctuations can save you money while you get reliable shipping services.

To get a headstart, it’s essential to know what affects the dry van shipping market. While many factors affect dry van rates, here are the main four:

### Location

Pickup and delivery location impact dry van rates. The path traveled by freight is called a lane –– and even though freight travels the same distance, different lanes will incur different rates.

Traveling through a busier lane with potentially more deliveries, such as highways, will have cheaper rates versus lanes along a rural area.

A shipment that requires deadheading, or traveling without a trailer, also drives up dry van quotes. This is usually when drivers need to get to a remote location just to make a single delivery.

### Trucking Supply and Demand

Demand for transportation is heavily influenced by the produce season, which starts in spring and ends in early summer. Shippers in the food industry are advised to plan their dry van shipments around this season, as higher demand equates to higher rates.

Supply in dry van shipping refers to truck and driver capacity. The fewer trucks and drivers available to make deliveries, the higher the dry van quotes will be. 

While this factor is more difficult to mitigate, some shippers opt for contracted rates to avoid sizable dry van rate fluctuations.

### Freight Description and Dimensions

The general rule with dry van shipping is the higher the weight and density of the freight, the higher the quote will be.

Especially if you’re shipping freight by truckloads, condensing your packages to take up less space can mean massive savings.

### Rare Events

Dry van freight rates are also affected by unique events, such as natural disasters that cause warehouses, factories, and even roads to close down.

In this case, it’s essential to partner with reliable and experienced providers that have the right tools for flexible and affordable shipments.
