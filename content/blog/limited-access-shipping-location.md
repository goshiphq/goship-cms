## **What does limited access mean in freight shipping?**

A limited access location is an area where pick up and delivery are restricted. It can mean the driver requires additional time and service to load and unload your goods. Limited access shipping sometimes also demands getting additional paperwork and going through security checks to prove the items you’re delivering are safe. Many shippers often don't know about common locations with limited access, so it is better to get familiar with the shipping regulations.

## **What places are considered limited access locations?**

Usually, delivery locations are considered limited access if loading and unloading processes take longer than 15 minutes and there are no loading docks that the trucks can pull up to. Since limited access places are sometimes situated in remote areas, drivers have to follow unpopular routes thus extending expected delivery deadlines. 

Limited access locations get their delivery restraints due to several common reasons. Most often, these places are unavailable for the general public during regular business hours or work according to a special schedule. In this case, you will have to make your delivery appointment in advance and inform the receiver about your arrival time. Beforehand appointments also apply to places with certain security restrictions, where you will have to spend some time going through security checks and inspections. Besides, some locations may be considered limited access because of their poor technical support or inability to accommodate certain kinds of trucks. You should also be aware of the specifics of shipping to [congested areas](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-port-congestion-will-affect-retailers-this-season) since their busy traffic can cause serious delivery delays.

## How to Avoid Limited Access Delivery Fees 

As mentioned above, advanced planning is the key to ship to limited access locations with no interruptions. Still, there are several useful practices that might help you avoid being charged for breaking the rules of limited access shipping:

* **Exploring the area through online maps.** Even though you may be generally familiar with the route you’re going to take, it will never be redundant to check out all the road features using maps applications or just pulling them up online. Moreover, modernized route explorers like [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) do not only show the road schemes but also provide lots of valuable information your drivers can take advantage of (for example, the data about the route passability as well as its congestion level).
* **Staying in touch with receivers.** This does not only allow you to keep them updated on your actual location and estimated delivery time, but you can additionally learn if there is all the necessary equipment you’ll need for unloading, or if the facility will be still open when you arrive. Effective communication will guarantee you a smooth transit and customer satisfaction.
* **Preparing for possible security checks**. If you are shipping to places with strict security orders like military instances or prisons, you will be required to provide certain identification documents and go through load security checks. It is better to count these rules and take care of all the crucial papers in advance.
* **Contacting the carrier.** When looking for a suitable carrier to deliver your goods to limited access locations, it is recommended to contact them and make sure their machinery meets your requirements and they are able to get the necessary paperwork if needed.
