One of the main factors of a positive experience with a shipping provider is getting an accurate [freight quote](https://app.goship.com/#/wizard) without hidden charges.

**What does limited access mean in freight shipping?**
------------------------------------------------------

A limited access location is an area where pick up and delivery are restricted. It can mean the driver requires additional time and service to load and unload your goods. Many shippers often don't know about common locations with limited access. So, we’ve compiled a list of areas that are hard to access or work at for you.

**What is considered a limited access location?**
-------------------------------------------------

*   Camps, fairs, carnivals, flea markets
*   Casinos
*   Cemeteries
*   Churches
*   Construction sites
*   Container freight
*   Correction facilities
*   Country clubs
*   Courthouses
*   Daycares
*   Farms

Many shippers mistakenly think the above locations are nothing different from commercial centers, and that don’t require special services. However, being unaware can cost you extra fees.
