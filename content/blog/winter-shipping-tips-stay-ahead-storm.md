When it comes to freight shipping, winter is probably the most problematic season. With unsavory road conditions, freezing temperatures, and other hazards, you never know what challenges can be lying ahead. However, if you plan your shipments early, you have a better chance of completing a successful delivery.



# How to ship during the winter season?



The cold weather makes the customers more likely to do more online shopping, significantly benefiting your business. So, there are many reasons to keep your supply chain active during wintertime. Yet, sometimes winter shipping is tricky to organize. Considering weather fluctuations during the cold shipping season is essential. Harsh winter storms seriously damage the cargo or completely block the traffic. It results in delayed delivery, goods defects, and customer dissatisfaction. As a responsible business owner, you want to avoid possible shipping disruptions and ensure maximum performance.



## Winter shipping tips



To make your supply chain work even in dire weather conditions, you need to predict the cold weather threats and think of ways to minimize their effects. Follow these crucial winter shipping tips to prevent your shipment from getting stuck in the snowstorm!



### Be aware of delays

[Delays](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-causes-freight-shipping-delays-and-how-to-avoid-them) are typical for the cold season shipping, and sometimes it’s impossible to complete the delivery on time. Still, you can mitigate the risks by booking your shipments and coordinating all the supply chain operations earlier. Leave yourself extra days for your shipment planning and use this time to check on the best routes, determine the transit requirements of your cargo, prepare appropriate packaging, and choose a suitable shipping provider. Also, you can look into the weather forecast and evaluate shipping-related recommendations. Knowing these critical points of your future shipment, you’ll figure out how much time you need to deliver the items.



### Know what you're shipping

Certain goods are not resistant to cold temperatures and require special shipping conditions. Without proper accommodations, you wouldn’t want to ship any plants, non-freeze liquids, or food products. Ensure you protect your items with appropriate insulation or consider using freeze protection services. If you’re going to move [pharmaceutical products](https://www.goship.com/healthcare) or [hazmats](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-ship-hazardous-materials-a-guide-to-hazmat-shipping), it’s vital to book a truck with a temperature regulation system. Thus, your items will remain unaffected by low degrees and won’t cause any danger during transportation. In addition, temperature regulation will keep the products safe in case of long tailbacks or other situations on the road.



### Stay in the loop



Try to keep in touch with your carrier so that both parties can understand their shipment expectations. You and your carrier can work together to ensure the cargo reaches its destination. Plus, you’ll stay updated in case of any changes or emerging problems. Consider opening a line of communication with the receiver, so they are aware of potential winter delays. Besides, you can offer your customers to [track the shipment](https://www.goship.com/posts/3-reasons-shipment-tracking-matters) through logistics apps to see the vehicle's exact location and contact the customer support team when needed.



### Consider using a warehouse

Since winter weather strongly impacts the shipment duration, it’s sometimes easier to place your products in a strategically located storage space. Thus, you won’t have to cover the whole distance in winter but will deliver goods from a warehouse and save much time. Although using warehouses may not be reasonable for you during other seasons, they can help you avoid winter shipping delays. Additionally, keeping the products in a storage space reduces their commute time, harmful to temperature-sensitive items.



### Count the holiday season



Most of the global [holidays](https://www.goship.com/posts/prepare-for-the-holiday-shipping-season) occur during the winter season, and the growing demand requires active shipping no matter what the weather is outside. One of your goals is to decrease the possibility of freight returns to exclude going back and forth on dangerous winter roads. You can do it by implementing [demand forecasting](https://www.goship.com/posts/demand-forecasting-in-logistics-how-to-increase-your-supply-chain-income) that aids retailers in predicting the volumes of ordered items. Knowing precisely how much cargo you’re going to ship will help you work out the shipping requirements and plan your supply chain operations better.



### Choose the right shipping provider



It’s critical to cooperate with a shipping service that knows how to deal with harsh weather and operate despite the obstacles of winter shipping. An experienced carrier will pick the optimal routes to deliver your goods without delays and supervise the products’ state throughout the shipment. When deciding on a suitable shipping service, pay attention to their shipping capacity and whether their transport means can appropriately accommodate your items. The carrier service's affordability is no less important, and GoShip can assist you with that. We will ensure your operations run smoothly and your products reach the receiver even during the wintertime.
