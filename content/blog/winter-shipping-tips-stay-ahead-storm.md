------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expect delays

Knowing that the weather can turn at any moment is important. Leave yourself extra days on your shipment plan so you can make sure it arrives on time. The earlier it’s out, the better.

### Stay in the loop

Maintain a line of communication with your carrier so both parties are able to understand what is expected of the shipment. You and your carrier can work together to monitor your shipment to ensure final delivery when you need it. It’s a good idea to also open a line of communication with the receiver so they can understand the potential Winter delays as well.

### Understand the conditions

Review all of your past data from your shipments to help you determine what the disruptions in the past have been like. This will help you foresee disruptions in the near future to consider as an addition to the weather. Monitoring weather patterns are useful and will help you function smoothly.

### Know what you're shipping

You wouldn’t want to ship any non-freeze liquids or food products without proper accommodations. Make sure you protect your items with proper insulation or consider the use of freeze protection services.
