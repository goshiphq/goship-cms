Flatbed shipping can offer many benefits over the other freight shipping types, especially if your cargo is of unusual shape or dimensions.

However, there are some intricacies in flatbed shipping that you need to know before proceeding with transportation.

## How to ship flatbed freight?

### Know your shipment

Regardless of which shipping method you choose, giving accurate shipping information is a must. This is extremely important when you are shipping oversize loads. Often, flatbed shipments require special permits to have specific regulations, so wrong weight or dimensions can result in extra charges. Shipment packaging and securing also matters. Flatbed shipments can be reliably fixed and taped from all sides, but you have to communicate all the requirements of your freight with the carrier, broker, or shipping service.

### Equipment type

There are many types of truck trailers, and when speaking of flatbed, there are also several subtypes. Your shipping service or a broker will most likely recommend you the right one (if you are working with a broker), but you have to specify as many details about your shipment as possible. Also, there are various ways to load and unload freight, which also depends on the type of shipment. The more correct information you have, the more chances you have to arrange a smooth and successful shipment with an accurate price estimate.

### Find reliable partners

Eventually, it all comes down to the service and equipment quality. It’s important to choose experienced shipping services or carriers because flatbed shipping is not an easy process with all the regulations and operational challenges. By working with a reliable shipping platform, you significantly reduce the chances of freight damage or other risks.
