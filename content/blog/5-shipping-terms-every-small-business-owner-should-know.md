Freight shipping can sometimes seem overwhelming to any business owner. If you want to find the best shipping strategy that will work for you and your customers, it’s critical to understand how the process works.

# Shipping terminology

It’s hard to imagine a successful shipment without being familiar with the most frequent concepts of freight shipping. Being familiar with popular shipping terms and their meanings will allow you to organize smooth logistics operations and escape possible confusion.

## What are the most critical shipping terms?

Knowledge of the principal concepts of freight shipping will help you better understand the structure of supply chain operations. Adding these popular logistics terms to your vocabulary is a great way to start taking control of your business shipping strategy. 

### Bill of Lading (BOL)

As a business owner, you are responsible for leading the necessary shipping documentation. [Bills of lading](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-complete-a-bol-bill-of-lading-form) are essential for the shipment because they serve as evidence of a contract between the shipper and carrier. This contract contains the main transportation details, including the description of shipped goods, the owner's information, and pick-up and delivery locations.

The BOL works as the receipt for every shipment –– it’s issued by the carrier upon picking up your package. Any mistake in the bill of lading can cause delivery or even payment delays. Without a correct BOL, packages can get lost, and it will be difficult to compensate for losses.

There are different types of bills of lading forms depending on the method you transport your goods. Depending on how you want to ship, you’ll need the ocean BOL, air BOL, or multimodal BOL to move goods through multiple shipping methods. Concerning goods ownership and financial responsibility, there can be straight BOLs and “to order” BOLs. Besides, the inland BOL is a document required for international cargo traveling by road or rail.

### Less than truckload

Less than truckload or LTL shipping is the transportation of freight that is more than 150 pounds but is less than the capacity of a trailer. In other words, shippers use [LTL mode](https://www.goship.com/posts/ltl-freight-shipping-for-beginners) when transporting cargo bigger than a parcel shipment but smaller than a full truckload.

Various shippers will transport goods in one truck, and each will pay only for the space consumed by their items. Because it’s a cost-effective option, small businesses usually switch to LTL as an efficient and scalable shipping method over parcel shipping.

The parcel's dimensions, freight route, distance traveled, type of goods, and delivery time will contribute to the cost when calculating less than truckload prices. Typically, LTL carriers collect shipments from different customers into one container, making this transportation mode affordable for all businesses. You only have to pay for the truck space used to place your products, thus effectively [saving transportation costs](https://www.goship.com/posts/7-ways-to-reduce-shipping-costs).

### Estimated shipping time

As the name suggests, an estimated shipping time or date is an educated guess on when the delivery will be shipped out. It may not always be accurate [due to delays](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-causes-freight-shipping-delays-and-how-to-avoid-them) and order fulfillment cutoffs. Estimated shipping times are given to customers to know when they should expect their order to be shipped and delivered.

On the other hand, the shipping time is the exact date and time when the carrier service picks up the order and moves it from the seller or warehouse to the customer. If you offer same-day shipping or two-day shipping, customers will expect their package to arrive at a date based on the actual shipping date.

### Guaranteed capacity

Carriers will try to load the cargo into a trailer before the estimated shipping date for regular freight bookings. Since space is not guaranteed, shippers will have to inform the shipper of any delays. Forwarders will need to look for alternative space by offering premium space, a different carrier, or delayed space with the same shipping service at an updated price.

Due to the high demand for freight services, carriers offer “guaranteed capacity” to shippers who want to [prepare for the peak season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-for-peak-season-shipping). Shippers who want to get a degree of certainty with shipping volume will need to pay a premium to lock in that capacity.

With guaranteed capacity, forwarders will pass the booking to the carrier once the booking is confirmed. The carrier service will then provide the vessel and transit details.

### 24/7 service

24/7 refers to services provided around the clock, from Monday through Sunday.

Some carriers might only accept bookings on weekends until 5 PM, but shipping services that offer 24/7 service will allow convenient quotation, booking, and confirmation any time of the day. It’s vital for small businesses that need to meet strict deadlines for shipment.

24/7 service is critical for shipping, especially for customer support. Should you need to inquire about the status of your delivery, the carrier will be able to address inquiries about the status of your order.
