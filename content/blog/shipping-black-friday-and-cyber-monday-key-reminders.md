Black Friday & Cyber Friday Shipping Tips
-----------------------------------------

### 1\. Check your inventory

Digital was already a massive trend before COVID-19, but now online shopping is bigger than ever. Most customers will be buying on the web, so your online presence is essential for a successful season. Make sure to check out your inventory and tackle any issues that can arise, so there are no bottlenecks when the shopping time starts.

### 2\. Offer visibility & communicate

Customer satisfaction is essential for a business’s growth, and especially in these turbulent times it is important to communicate with your audience. Don’t forget to make your customers aware of your shipping deadlines or any potential delays that can pop up.

### 3\. Partner with reliable shipping services

Shipping is the last leg of your supply chain and a link between your business and a customer. So, partnering with a reliable shipping platform is an important part of a shipping strategy, especially during the holiday season.
