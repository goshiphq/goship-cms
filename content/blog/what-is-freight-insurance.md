# What is freight insurance?



Freight insurance is the additional protection that covers your cargo in case of loss or damage. Cargo insurance keeps you calm and confident during the shipping process. If something happens to your freight, the insurer will reimburse its value so you don't have to cover the expenses yourself. Freight insurance can be ordered from the shipping company or third-party insurers. Depending on your business needs, there are several [types](https://www.goship.com/posts/an-introduction-to-freight-insurance) of freight shipping isurance. 

## **What is the difference between freight insurance and freight liability?**

Shippers often assume that freight insurance and freight liability are the same when actually, they’re not. Every booked shipment comes with limited liability coverage, and the word “limited” explains the main difference. The final amount of coverage is based on the commodity type and defined by the carrier’s tariffs. In most cases, it does not fully cover your shipment’s value, especially when it’s high. 

Carriers can pay you the refund when the cargo is destructed due to their fault. To receive the maximum amount of **carrier’s coverage liability**, you have to prove your goods were packed properly and undamaged at the pick-up. Under the circumstances like bad weather conditions and natural disasters, the carrier is not completely liable for your freight.

With the insurance, you are safe no matter what happens to your freight. You also won’t have to prove the incident was the carrier’s fault. If your goods are shipped via freight insurance, you don't need to wait until your claim is processed or stress out about whether you will get a refund or not. Compared to liability coverage, **freight insurance** offers much more comfort for the shipper and lets you receive a refund faster. Typically, claims are paid within 30 days instead of several months. In the long run, getting freight insurance is a cost-effective solution. 

## **In which case should I get freight insurance?**

While booking a shipment and partnering with a certain carrier, figure out what is the maximum liability coverage for your commodities. If your freight value exceeds the stated amount, it is better to get insurance. Also, cargo insurance is essential when:

* You ship fragile goods
* The cost of a product is very high
* You don’t have time to wait for claim processing in the case of freight damage or loss

## **There are some important things you should take care of, even with insurance:**

* Make sure to provide proper packaging for your goods, for it is the first step to avoid damage. Whether they are fragile or require additional protection, ensure the safe conditions for transportation.
* Giving accurate and comprehensive information about your freight is necessary. It will save you time and money in case of cargo damage.
* Take pictures of your freight before the transit. It is a good recommendation that can be helpful while reviewing reasons for freight damage/loss.
