The shipping industry is constantly being changed by new technology, ranging from the ELD mandate to the idea of autonomous trucks. Technology is almost unavoidable in today’s society and has changed the way people ship. Consumers become more and more conventional to technology, and many businesses focus on staying ahead of technology to provide customers with a seamless shopping and shipping experience. One way businesses are utilizing new technology is with shipment tracking. Shipment tracking is a new feature that many shipping services are implementing to [give customers full visibility](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/) of their shipment. Today we will be covering the top reasons why tracking is not only important to customers, but to businesses as well.

**Enhances the Shipping Experience**
------------------------------------

Being able to track a shipment allows businesses to keep track of and avoid lost shipments. Cargo tracking can also let shippers know of any issues that occurred on the package's journey from origin to destination. Companies that offer load tracking can better satisfy their customers and give them peace-of-mind during the shipping process.

**Reduces Unwanted Fees and Delays**
------------------------------------

Tracking a shipment’s journey can help companies track fees that might occur during the shipping process. When shippers can see problems occurring during their shipment, they can make the necessary changes to avoid unwanted costs due to delays or changing pick up times. Without shipment tracking, fees could be unavoidable.

**Keeps Customers Coming Back**
-------------------------------

Many customers can become very stressed when arranging a shipment. Especially, if the items are important and valuable. Many shippers prefer to use a service that offers shipment tracking. That way, they can have control over their shipment and reduce stress. Shipment tracking can help build a better relationship between the customer and the company.
