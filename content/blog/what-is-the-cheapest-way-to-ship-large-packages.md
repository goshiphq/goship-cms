## **How do you ship a large package?**

It is not a surprise if you find large-item shipping prices to be confusing. The thing is, if your goods exceed certain weight and size limits, they are considered [freight](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping). Freight is a large shipment transported by truck, rail, ship, or aircraft. Consequently, freight shipping prices are formed in a different way than parcel shipping rates. Regular postal services like UPS, FedEx, and USPS are great for shipping small parcels, but they have a completely different approach to calculating cargo [shipping rates](https://www.goship.com/posts/best-ltl-shipping-rates). If you are moving freight, it is better to consider other transportation options. Before jumping straight to the shipping process, it is best to understand how freight rates are formed.

## **How much does it cost to ship a large package?**

While parcel pricing is more generalized, freight shipping rates depend on the particular measures. To fully understand the basics of freight shipping pricing, let’s go over the [main factors](https://www.goship.com/posts/best-ltl-shipping-rates) that impact it:

* **Density.** It may seem unusual, but [dense shipments are cheaper to send](https://www.goship.com/posts/density-affect-ltl-shipping). The denser your load is, the less it is prone to damage during transit, and the safer it looks for the carrier. Loose or [fragile items](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-ship-fragile-items) can be way more expensive to move than heavy and dense items.
* **Weight**. Essentially, weight is a major contributor to your shipping cost. The most important thing here is to provide accurate information because any errors can result in additional charges.
* **Dimensions.** Shipment dimensions are important since it determines the space your load will take in the trailer. Also, carriers and shipping services will pay attention to the stackability and shape of the load - the easier it is to stack, the lower the price is.
* **Freight class** is a special [classification](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-freight-class) developed by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association ([NMFTA](http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc)) to ease the cargo shipping pricing. There are 18 classes, ranging from 50 to 500. Each of them has a specific code that applies to a certain type of freight.
* **Destination.** Obviously, mileage plays a role in determining the final shipping price. The longer the route, the more you will pay. Additionally, there is such thing as limited access shipping, which is a location or area that is hard for the carrier to reach or to unload. This often confuses shippers because a limited access location can be a residence or another place that is considered a normal location by the shipper. You can read the list of GoShip.com’s limited locations [here](https://www.goship.com/posts/limited-access-shipping-location).
