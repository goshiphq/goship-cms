Moving day is all about preparation, you have planned for this day and you are ready… or are you? When the day is nearly upon you, sometimes you accidentally skipped over something while in a whirlwind of things to complete. Knowing the moving lingo is important as you may hear these terms being used multiple times. Knowing these terms in advance will make it easier for you to ask the right questions and be properly prepared. Read below for the key moving terms to learn before you make a move.

Bill of Lading
--------------

A bill of lading is a required document that is used to move all shipments. It basically acts as a receipt for the services you are requiring. It is a legal contract between the shipper and the carrier for the shipment. You can’t ship without having one, it must accompany the shipped goods at all times and must be signed by the carrier, shipper, and receiver.

Consignee/Cosigner
------------------

The consignee is the individual who will be on the receiving end of the shipment. The cosigner is the person at the origin location that begins the shipment. If you’re making a move where you are the sender and receiver, then technically you are both the consignee and the consigner.

Accessorial Charges
-------------------

Any additional services, outside of the standard services, you add to your shipment is considered accessorial charges, that’s the simplest way to understand it. The services could be something like inside delivery, liftgate service, or limited access locations to name a few. It’s always good to understand these charges before you sign the bill of lading.

Claim
-----

In the incidence of damage or loss, a claim is made indicating what occurred. It is an important document to file if you should require it, always [file a claim](https://www.goship.com/blog/freight-damage-how-to-file-a-freight-claim/) as soon as possible to make sure it can be covered.

Linehaul Charges
----------------

These are basic charges you may see mentioned on your final bill. They consist of basic charges for long distance moves based on the mileage and weight of the shipment.

Reweigh
-------

After having your shipment loaded onto a truck, your carrier will visit a weigh-in station which will provide them with accurate total weight. The total of the bill could be changed if the weight value you provided was inaccurate. This is why it’s important to have your dimensions and weight as accurate as possible.

Operating Authority
-------------------

This is a certification that the government will issue that authorizes the movement of your shipment between different geographical areas. These are important for the carrier to have before you sign the bill of lading. Don’t worry if you have moving terms you still don’t understand all the terms. If you still need help, always ask questions. Your carrier will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have before or after your shipment with them.
