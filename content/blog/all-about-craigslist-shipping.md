**How to ship large items?**
----------------------------

Large items are often too large for regular parcel shipping companies, and the process of shipping those items may become difficult. Although shipping large items may seem like a burdensome procedure, it’s not that difficult. There are special shipping services that transport freight, and your oversized shipment may be just the right size for them. Most larger than parcel shipments are moved with less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping services. This means your items don’t require the full trailer space and will go with other shipments through a similar destination. [LTL shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/ltl-freight-shipping-guide/) lets you save costs on transportation and move items safely.

**How to arrange a Craigslist shipping?**
-----------------------------------------

Thanks to advanced technology, you don’t have to go through stressful operations to manage your shipment. There are online shipping services like GoShip.com where you can fill in the basic information about your item and choose the transportation option online. Larger shipments may require more complex processes, but with services like GoShip.com, booking a shipment goes as smooth as possible.

**What do I have to take care of?**
-----------------------------------

Choosing a convenient LTL shipping service will take the hassle out of the shipping process, but there are still some important things you should take care of. First and foremost, you need to provide accurate and complete information about your items to get the most relevant price and avoid confusion throughout the shipping process. If you are a seller, it is essential to provide proper packing for your freight. Depending on the shipment’s type and sizes, it may need palletizing, crating or other types of protection. Some services offer a packing option, but it’s better to specify it with a shipping company at the very start. In case you’re a buyer, you have to discuss delivery terms with a seller and figure out whether the shipment will be unloaded at the distribution center or if you need to set up a delivery appointment. After all, Craigslist shipping is easier than ever with the latest services and technology. You can communicate online, arrange delivery in just a few clicks, and wait for the shipment’s arrival or delivery.
