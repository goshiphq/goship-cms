Starting a small business requires a stream of finances, among other essentials. However, access to financial resources is not always easy to obtain. Luckily, there are places you can go for help in attaining small business resources. After all, having a reliable partner to assist with financial aid, creditors, and guidance can make or break your business. 

Where can small businesses go for all kinds of help?  

## The U.S. Small Business Association  

The Small Business Association (SBA) is an organization that helps businesses kickstart and manage operations. As an institution renowned nationwide and recognized by the federal government, the SBA is proven to be credible. 

The association helps small businesses with loan applications, forgiveness, and other considerations with various affiliations and partnerships. If you need help extending your dues, the SBA can review your Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) eligibility.   

There’s so much more to learn before starting a small business and even more in managing a successful one. Learning the ropes is a demanding feat, but it will be the most rewarding undertaking you will take on for yourself. With the proper guidance and assistance, you might just have the next industry-giant operating worldwide. 

Here are some other duties the U.S. Small Business Association can help your small business with:  

## Launching your business  

When launching a small business, start with the necessary financing. The association’s funding programs help small business owners access the capital they need. If you want to start a business but have no means of funding it, you can put together your business plan and present it to the SBA.  

### SBA-guaranteed loans  

Your plans backed by the SBA can help secure a loan through its funding programs. The SBA can connect you with the appropriate lenders that best suit your business plan.   

With the SBA-backed loans’ guidelines that reduce the lending partner’s risk, small businesses have better chances of getting loan applications approved. The lenders will manage your loans accordingly upon your loan’s approval. You can look for a lender in your area that matches your business’ needs on [Lender Match](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/lender-match).   

The core benefits of SBA-backed loans are their initial convenience and their long-term management. Small businesses are protected from predatory lenders who may take advantage of them.  

With Lender Match, loan agreements are beneficial to both parties with flexible terms, premiums, and overhead requirements. To aid both the lending partner and the small business, both will have access to supportive financial literacies.   

On top of guiding small businesses with loan applications, the SBA helps its owners understand day-to-day operations and expenses.  

## Managing your business   

While managing your business can be taxing, the SBA’s unlimited counseling helps lift some of the weight. You don’t have to figure it all out by yourself. After your initial consultations, you will still have access to SBA-certified counselors.   

### Business guide  

You can go on the SBA’s website to [find a counselor](https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance) in your area. Each counselor is equipped with the know-how to guide you through paying taxes, legal compliances, emergencies, employment, marketing, and sales.    

Counselors can also help you evaluate faltering business strategies and accommodate circumstances you are facing with finances, assets, employees, and logistical issues.   

Small businesses that work on Federal contracts must also adhere to another set of guidelines concerning provisions that protect the integrity of Federal and local government officials.   

### Federal contracting  

SBA-certified counselors help verse you on the Code of Federal Regulations (CRF) and the code of ethics that applies to government officials and their acquisitions, known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Counselors also help familiarize business owners with government-related labor standards relevant to service, safety, and work hours.   

If you want to know more about Federal contracting regulations, you can read the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=50ff66d5d1cc9357d5f4ce114fcc5c79&mc=true&node=pt13.1.125&rgn=div5) here.    

Yes, there are so many things you need to keep in mind and learn anew, but the CFR isn’t all the Small Business Association can guide you through.  

### Learning platform  

The SBA’s learning center comprises other contracting guides and assistance. It is an online platform where small business owners can learn the basics of business and advanced courses for owners who want to grow theirs.  

Entrepreneurial education also helps transition owners who previously served in the United States Armed Forces and their spouses. Its Boots to Business (B2B) program supports veterans in starting a business and introduces them to business ownership basics. The SBA also offers military families further education, an option known as the B2B: Revenue Readiness.   

The SBA learning platform includes a specialized forum for women entrepreneurs, Ascent. With the increasing numbers of new businesses, more and more women have become solo and co-founders of small businesses.   

The latest statistics show that 45% of small businesses are woman-owned or run. The platform features forums, exercise tools, independent courses, and infographics to help you grow your business in the direction you want.   

Most woman-managed businesses are product-centric, with some even conducting their shipment and deliveries. A common practice among small business owners who sell products is to start by managing their deliveries. However, handling deliveries with larger volumes or across city lines is more taxing as businesses grow. 

## Small business shipping and handling  

Logistics is a tricky business; it requires a fair amount of focus when running a successful small business. 

Delivery, handling, and shipping your products aren’t something you should overlook in planning your business. It can be expensive, but you don’t want to entrust your products or your reputation with a delivery partner that’s less than reliable.   

Reputable couriers may not be the cheapest, but they are worth it in protecting your relationship with clients and overall standing. There are affordable agencies out there that offer reliable services.    

### Freight shipping for small businesses  

[GoShip](https://www.goship.com/) is a nationwide freight shipping marketplace for small business owners.   

Whether you are looking for a partner that provides Less-than Truckload service or can accommodate Full Truckloads, GoShip has forty-two thousand certified carriers who can attend to your needs.   

We understand small business resources are often limited, and spending too much on a shipping partner can be a scary thought. GoShip’s freight reliable shipping prices are some of the most affordable you will find on the market.
