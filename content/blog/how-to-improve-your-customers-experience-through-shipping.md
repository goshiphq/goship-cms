The retail industry is constantly expanding, and every year the competition among retailers gets fiercer. As the e-commerce sector reaches its peak growth, online stores are becoming the shopping channel used most by consumers. There are many key performance indicators (KPIs) that define if the company is evolving or not, but the one that has become extremely valuable in recent years is customer experience. **What is customer experience?** Customer experience is someone’s experience involving every interaction of a business and a customer, including pre-sale and after-purchase communication and experience. A recent study by American Express stated that [60% of customers would pay more](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/what-customers-want-you-to-know-about-them/) money to get a better experience shopping. Customer experience is a crucial part of a company’s strategy and becomes a crucial measurement of success to help increase revenue. **Why is it important to your business?** All recent studies prove that in the upcoming years, customer experience is going to become the central field of investments and interest among retail companies. [Research](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1903222) by Oracle found that 74% of senior executives believe that good customer experience directly impacts customers’ retention, while the [study](https://blogs.sap.com/2011/10/28/the-customer-experience-edge/) by Bloomberg Businessweek stated that 75.9% of management executives put customer experience as a top priority of their business strategy. Despite such a high awareness of the importance of good customer experience, only [8% of customers think they get a great experience](http://bain.com/bainweb/pdfs/cms/hotTopics/closingdeliverygap.pdf). There could be a difference in how businesses view customer experience compared to what customers actually want. There are many ways for companies to work to satisfy their customers and gain their loyalty, and one of those ways is to provide quality shipping. **How can shipping enhance your customers’ experience?** Regardless of how great your product is, if you are an online retailer, delivery is the most important part of the customers experience. Shipping can either positively or negatively impact the customer. Here are some ways to assure your target audience gets the best of your company’s services:

*   **Personal approach.** The Journal of Consumer Research found that [50% of customer experience is based on emotions](http://www.ejcr.org/), so sending a personalized and attractive parcel would increase the chances of impressing your customer.
*   **Shipment visibility.** Make sure your customers have access to real-time tracking of their shipment and send them updates. And don’t forget about communication – let your clients know about any delays or other circumstances and serve their emails, calls, and requests quickly and properly.
