Shipment safety is an important concern when arranging the delivery. That's why packaging and protection play a significant role in your freight's security. When deciding to ship your items, it is important to know the difference between package and pallet shipping. Depending on what you are shipping, you will need to know whether a package or pallet best fits your shipment.

## What is the difference between package and pallet shipping?

A package is usually a cardboard box that smaller items are shipped in. This can range from clothing items to car tires. A package is simply a parcel in the form of a compact unit. However, for larger shipments, you will need more convenient protection. A pallet is normally used when you have multiple packages to ship at once. The standard size pallet is 48” x 40” and can normally hold about 4,600 lbs.

## How do I know when to use a pallet?

Using a pallet is a smart choice when shipping using LTL and can help ease the loading and unloading process. Pallet shipping can be more expensive than package shipping but can ensure that your shipment gets delivered efficiently and safely to its destination. Choosing the wrong pallet for your shipment can lead to damages to the items you are having shipped. When choosing a pallet for your shipment, you want to choose one that is made of sturdy wood that can hold up the weight of your shipment and the freight that will be stacked on top of it. Pallet shipments are wrapped in a protective plastic film to further ensure the safety of your shipment. As you can see, differentiating between a package and a pallet shipment can be easy once you gain a good understanding of the role of each method. Make sure to apply this knowledge whenever you are choosing a method for your next shipment!
