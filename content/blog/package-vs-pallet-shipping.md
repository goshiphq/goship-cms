Depending on what you are shipping, you will need to know whether a package or pallet best fits your shipment.

# What is the difference between packages and shipping pallets?

A package is usually a cardboard box that smaller items are shipped. This can range from clothing items to car tires. A package is simply a [parcel](https://www.goship.com/posts/understanding-ltl-and-parcel-shipping-what-is-best-for-my-small-business1) in the form of a compact unit. This packaging type is suitable for shipments of a moderate size that don't require special handling or extra fixation.

However, for larger shipments, you will need high-quality protection. A pallet is normally used when you have multiple packages to ship at once. The standard pallet sizes are 48” x 40” and can normally hold about 4,600 lbs.

## How do I know when to use a pallet?

Using a pallet is a smart choice when [shipping using LTL](https://www.goship.com/posts/palletizing-ltl-freight-everything-you-need-to-know) and can help ease the loading and unloading process. Pallet shipping can be more expensive than package shipping but can ensure that your shipment gets delivered efficiently and safely to its destination. Choosing the wrong pallet for your shipment can lead to damages to the items you are having shipped. 

When choosing a pallet for your shipment, you want to choose reliable wooden pallets of a high quality that can hold up the weight of your shipment and the freight that will be stacked on top of it. Pallet shipments are wrapped in a protective plastic film or stretch wrap to further ensure the safety of your shipment. 

## Types of shipping pallets

It is important to apply proper shipping pallets that better accommodate the items you are shipping. Depending on their structure, there are two main [types of shipping pallets](https://www.goship.com/posts/a-guide-to-different-types-of-shipping-pallets). **Block pallets** can be loaded from any side and are widely used for transporting [large](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/large-item-shipping) and heavy items. **Stringer pallets** consist of 3 wooden stringers and can be loaded from two sides.

Sometimes, shippers use plastic pallets considering them firmer to carry heavyweight cargo. However, wooden shipping pallets have proved to be the optimal packaging method for any type of goods. Besides, wooden pallets are made of sustainable material to allow your shipping operations to become more [eco-friendly](https://www.goship.com/posts/sustainable-strategy-eco-friendly-packaging).
