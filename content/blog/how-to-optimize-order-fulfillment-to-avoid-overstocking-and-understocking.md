Overstocking and understocking are common outcomes when retail businesses try to predict market demand and forecast the customers’ purchasing trends. However, modern supply chain and logistics offer a number of effective solutions to help you meet your buyers’ needs and avoid these challenges.

# Why Do Overstocking and Understocking Happen in Retail Logistics?

Due to the rapid development of eCommerce platforms, customers are getting pickier about their shopping choices, which makes it harder to stock the right amount of goods. Overstocking and understocking can make retail costs go up and bring frustration to customers. In most cases, the worst stocking issues occur because of poor planning. 

That is why it is extremely important to upgrade your business strategy repeatedly, taking into account changes in your target audience’s purchasing activity. It is also crucial to generate your stocking scope according to your [budgeting](https://www.goship.com/posts/3-tips-for-transportation-budgeting-in-2021) since it includes expenses for many supply chain operations besides the manufacturing itself. 

Sometimes, over- and understocking happen due to a lack of data analytics and marketing to understand the demand. Modern advertising techniques allow retailers to spawn their production on any online resources and social media. Likewise, gathering feedbacks and analyzing customers’ satisfaction from the items you offer can help you foresee your future sales.

## How Do Overstocking and Understocking Affect Your Retail Business?

There are many negative effects that out-of-stock and overstocking can lead your business to. 

On the one hand, empty shelves of the regular stores or online marketplaces result in breaking buyers’ expectations and losing your customers. According to numerous [researches](https://www.redcloudtechnology.com/redcloud-news/2021/2/18/out-of-stock-and-empty-shelves-could-be-costing-retailers-1t), understocking can cause immense financial losses for retail businesses. Out-of-stock threatens long-standing retailers who have gained their audience’s trust and set a certain standard of their product availability. Buyers which are used to getting particular items from the same retailer may never return if these goods have been missing for some time.

On the other hand, the excessive presence of your product on the market can become a signal of a limited amount of what you can suggest to your buyers in the future. Retailers who have just started shipping their goods are often afraid of being out of stock, which makes them oversupply the stores with their goods. This usually happens because of the lack of supply chain experience and lack of planning. 

As a result, you are likely to lose the finances you put into the production of certain goods that haven’t turned out to be popular among your customers. Frequently, the redundant supply provokes [deadstock issues](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-deadstock-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it), when you are no more capable of releasing your products at a profitable retail price so that they are being kept at warehouses bringing no income to your business.

## How to Avoid Overstocking and Understocking?

Despite all the challenges, it is possible to avoid the conditions of overstocking and understocking in terms of active trade and logistics. There are several helpful practices you can imply to work out the best solutions for your stock amounts and supply chain sequence.

Understanding buyers’ demand is the key to determining the most optimal stock volumes to fill in the shelves.

In case you are a new player in the retail arena, you can try examining your direct competitors’ stocking strategy. Anyway, getting to know your customers is always a good idea. Observe what and when they normally buy, what prices scale is the most comfortable for them, as well as what platform (offline and online) they prefer to use.

It is principal to take into account the factors affecting customers' interest in different products. The demand for certain types of items tends to grow approaching the [holidays season](https://www.goship.com/posts/prepare-for-the-holiday-shipping-season) and periods of [large-scale sales](https://www.goship.com/posts/shipping-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-key-reminders) like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. This is when you will be arranging more shipments to fulfill the requirement, so make sure the wares' quantity is enough not to run out of stock.
