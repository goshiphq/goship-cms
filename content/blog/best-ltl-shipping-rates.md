If you are shipping goods across the country, you probably look for the lowest freight shipping rates. While many online shipping services offer free quote comparison, it can be tricky to choose the best one for your needs. Shippers are often unaware of how they can reduce shipping costs on their own. Before diving into the shipment booking process, you should know some tips and tricks on how to save on transportation and get the best freight rates:

**Provide Accurate Information**
--------------------------------

Beginner shippers often make a common mistake by stating approximate information about their freight. When calculating freight quotes, dimensions, weight, and density are key measures, and small differences can bring you additional charges and fees. Make sure to properly measure your package to avoid higher rates and confusion.

**Consolidate and Pack Your Shipments**
---------------------------------------

If you ship boxes via an LTL shipping service, it is highly recommended to put your boxes onto a pallet and stack them. This will help to simplify handling, ensure shipment protection, and reduce your spending. How? Firstly, a pallet of multiple boxes or packages is considered a single piece, so it will eliminate per item cost. Also, it is cheaper to ship several pallets at once instead of moving separate boxes frequently. _Read more about [Packing and Palletizing your Shipment](https://www.goship.com/blog/package-vs-pallet-shipping/)_

**Determine Your Freight Class Correctly**
------------------------------------------

To simplify the standardization and provide fair freight pricing, the [National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA)](http://www.nmfta.org/Home/Index) created a set of rules known as "freight classification." This means every type of freight should be classified with a special [NMFC (National Motor Freight Classification)](http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc) code. Classes vary from 50 to 500, and the lower the number is, the cheaper the rate you’ll get. Therefore, choosing proper freight class impacts shipping costs. Luckily, online shipping services like GoShip.com have automated freight class calculator to make shipping easier for you. _Read more about freight classification in [LTL Freight Shipping Guide](https://www.goship.com/blog/ltl-freight-shipping-guide/)_

**Consider Carrier Tariffs**
----------------------------

The final cost of your shipping is highly affected by the regulations and rules of a certain carrier. Mainly, these tariffs depend on pickup or delivery location. Some destinations are hard to access or remote, and some locations include regional fees and surcharges. If the lane goes into a big city with highway congestion, you can be additionally charged. It is important to communicate all details about your shipment to help avoid these issues.

**Choose a Reliable Online Shipping Service**
---------------------------------------------

No matter if you are a small business owner or an individual shipper, arranging freight transportation can be stressful. However, innovative shipping services like GoShip.com make this process seamless and smooth.
