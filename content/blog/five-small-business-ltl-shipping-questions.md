When you're trying to find the best shipping options for small businesses, the number of options available can be truly mind-boggling. Yet which small business shipping options are the right ones for your company and products? Many small businesses find that shipping items using a less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier helps them save money while getting their products where they need to go. Here's a quick look at the five LTL shipping questions to always consider when setting up a small business logistics plan.

5 LTL shipping questions to ask yourself before shipping:
---------------------------------------------------------

### **Are your items packaged properly?**

When a company uses an LTL carrier, the goods need different packaging than simply tossing a box in the mail. Many LTL companies will require the load to be on a pallet to reduce loading and unloading times. You'll also want to make sure your products are secure, using tape, blocks or straps to restrain any moving parts and filling the additional space in the container to prevent shifting during transport.

### **How do you track your shipment?**

There are few things as stressful for your small business logistics department as trying to track down a missing shipment. The time involved distracts your workers from their regular jobs, costing your company both time and money in the process. Don't underestimate the importance of freight tracking when choosing an LTL carrier.

### **Are you using the right freight classification?**

When preparing a shipment, you'll determine the correct freight classification to get an accurate shipping rate. This classification is based on the weight, size, density, value, potential liability and the ease of handling the item. Generally speaking, a lower classification number equals a lower shipping rate. However, if you've improperly classified the freight, you may see additional fees for both the corrected shipping amount, as well as the time and effort, took to reclassify your freight by the carrier.

### **Is the LTL carrier the right one for your company?**

LTL carriers have different specialties, which may be based on shipment classification, distance, delivery services, and similar issues. What type of freight do you most often ship? You'll want to find out the prospective carrier's details before you begin shipping with them. If your shipments will cover a wide range of specialties and distances, you may want to partner with a shipper that works with a range of LTL carriers.

### **Which factors impact LTL shipping rates?**

There can be a wide range of factors that determine your shipping rates. What's the classification of your freight? How far is it going? Are there any hazardous materials, pressurized items or similar issues of concern for the shipment? What about ease of handling? These factors all come into play when calculating your overall shipping rate.
