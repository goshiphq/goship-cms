## What are the disadvantages of dry van shipping?

Despite dry vans working for almost everyone, but it doesn’t quite fit every shipment. While being highly functional and versatile, dry van trucking can be complicated sometimes.

### Tight capacity

A dry van is the most popular type of freight truck transportation, and it faces an extremely high demand, especially in the peak season. So, it may be problematic to find capacity if you have large volumes of shipments.

### No temperature control

Dry vans don’t have any climate regulation, so if you are shipping perishable food, beverages, flowers, fine art, or other products that can’t survive temperature difference, a dry van is not an option for you.

### Wooden floors

In most dry van trailers, there are wooden floors that are vulnerable to high humidity and moisture. These floors can easily be damaged, which means that the carrier will need to repair the truck. Despite these drawbacks, dry vans remain the most popular freight trailers in the shipping industry.
