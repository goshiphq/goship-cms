### Tight seasonal capacity

A dry van is the most popular type of freight truck transportation, and it faces an extremely high demand during the [peak season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-for-peak-season-shipping). It may appear quite problematic to find transportation capacity if you have to ship large freight volumes within the holiday season. However, early planning can help you avoid shipping issues.

### No temperature control

Dry vans don’t have any climate regulation, so if you are shipping perishable food, beverages, flowers, fine art, or other products that can’t survive temperature differences, a dry van is not the best option for you. Instead, pay attention to [refrigerated trailers](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-refrigerated-shipping-and-how-does-it-work) that are designed to keep your items safe from any unexpected situations.

### Wooden floors
