Every business person knows how critical it is to work with reliable partners. It primarily refers to suppliers representing the core of the retail supply chain. An advanced approach and effective business communication will make you preferable to well-grounded vendors.

# Why are shipper/supplier relationships important?



Business successes and increased sales in the retail industry are directly dependent on the supply flow. If you want to grow your income and become a more established player in the market, it is vital to find a partner who matches your objectives and shares your view of business management. Being on the same page with your supplier will enhance the performance of both sides and give a great start to your supply chain.



After aligning your plans with a vendor, you have to work on upgrading your professional relationships constantly. Whether you are getting materials or whole products from your supplier, staying in touch and keeping each other updated on various changes is needed. Luckily, modern technologies provide many opportunities to communicate under different circumstances without interrupting the supply chain and logistics operations. 



## How to develop trusted supplier relationships?



Cultivating trusted supplier relationships isn’t the easiest thing to do. However, staying open about your business plans and maintaining communication with your vendor will establish a deep professional connection.



### Communicate effectively



Productive cooperation with a supplier is all about personal communication. The real-time interaction with your business partner helps regulate the majority of questions. Organizing a supply chain is more than just coordinating activities. Try to communicate your needs and supply expectations clearly, so there is no mismatching between production and distribution. It is vital to establish an effective connection with your manufacturer at the beginning of the partnership. You’ll be able to outline your goals and determine the business pattern that works for both sides. Seek to personalize your connection: if possible, meet your supplier face-to-face, or invite them to your office.



During the further collaboration, arranged communication will help you avoid numerous issues, such as mistaken orders or [wrong volumes](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-optimize-order-fulfillment-to-avoid-overstocking-and-understocking) of requested goods. It will allow you to discuss improvements in production and retail operations. Both you and your vendor will benefit from active teamwork and mutual business experience. Simultaneously, you’ll become loyal, long-term partners. 



### Track your results

Sharing sales analytics with your partner is essential for dedicated shipper/supplier relationships. By tracking the results, both parties can evaluate the working efficiency and suggest fresh ideas for future development. Analyzing your sales can show what products your buyers appreciate the most. It is a powerful indicator of the advantages of your business strategy. The customer demand information also concerns your vendor, who can thus evaluate the quality of supplied items. It will also aid you in forming more precise supply orders and prioritizing those goods that you’re sure of selling out.



In addition, observing your successes can reveal whether your collaboration with the manufacturer will remain fruitful in the long run. There’s nothing wrong with changing a vendor and looking for more suitable options. However, since trusted relationships objectively are hard to build, it is worth figuring out some business solutions and overcoming difficulties in partnership.

### Control the payment process



Payment conditions play a determinant role in the supplier/retailer relationship. It is crucial to hold all the financial transactions within set deadlines and avoid missing the payment. Of course, your business can go through different periods and situations. For example, shipping items during the [peak season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-for-peak-season-shipping) brings high income and doesn’t cause any payment inconveniences. On the other hand, the slow season is sometimes difficult for retailers and requires better [budget planning](https://www.goship.com/posts/3-tips-for-transportation-budgeting-in-2021). If you can’t pay the bills on time, it is necessary to notify the supplier and agree to new terms. Together you will work out the delay solution and form the optimal supply order for your next cooperation.



Regular payment assures the supplier’s trust. If you stick to the consistent payment schedule, the vendor will likely do you a good turn later. When you need to place an extra supply or call for rush order, your partner will assist you, relying on your established relationship.

### Work with professional carriers

Reliable delivery services are the guarantors of a successful final stage of the logistics process. Cooperating with suitable carriers will ensure the supplier’s products or materials reach their destination without significant problems. Well-organized shipping operations are not solely your priority; suppliers are no less interested in a solid supply chain structure. If your suppliers see you doing well with logistics management, they will view you as a trusted partner.



Besides transporting itself, professional shippers take care of the cargo's safety and integrity. As a responsible retailer, you always pay attention to freight protection and pick good packaging.
