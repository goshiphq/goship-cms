Winter is known to be a harvesting season, and springtime traditionally marks the start of the fresh produce shipping season. Most fruit and vegetable farmers and importers start to look for the capacity to distribute their products across the country when the demand for fresh produce greatly increases. Grocery stores, supermarkets, and restaurants need seasonal fruit and veggies to sustain their businesses.

When is produce shipping season?
--------------------------------

Produce season usually starts in April and lasts till the end of summer. It is the peak season for fresh produce farmers and distributors, making it one of the busiest seasons of the year. Regardless of the circumstances, greenery and veggies are always in high demand during this time. As fresh produce is transported only through refrigerated trucks, the temperature-controlled capacity begins to tighten, and freight rates increase, sometimes [as much as 30%](https://www.dat.com/company/news-and-events/news-releases/spring-surge-begins-for-truckload-freight-and-rates-dat-freight-index).

How do you ship fresh produce?
------------------------------

### Plan in advance

Understanding the truckload demand and specifics of regional distribution is the key to successfully getting through the produce shipping season. If you plan to work with high-quality carriers, start navigating the market in winter. Also, fresh produce is typically harvested in the southern states, so these areas will be the busiest during peak season. Creating a proper [shipping strategy](https://www.goship.com/blog/creating-a-successful-small-business-shipping-strategy/) will help you define the market trends and successfully ship your produce.

### Use reliable truckload carriers

Since temperature controlled, or refrigerated trucks are usually handled by [full truckload carriers](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping/), you absolutely want to use the best options out there. Shipping food products is challenging since your goods have to be delivered in excellent condition. Maintaining an attractive appearance and condition is only possible with proper temperature control and good service. When looking for a carrier, make sure the company is compliant with the FDA [Food Safety Modernization Act](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-sanitary-transportation-human-and-animal-food).

### Take care of the packaging

After all, much of shipping produce depends on how you pack and protect your products. Make sure all the packages are properly sealed, boxed, covered, or stacked to minimize the damage while in transit.
