Freight shipping is the process of transporting goods, commodities, and cargo by land, sea, or air. The most common freight shipping modes are: full truckload (FTL), less than truckload (LTL), international marine shipping, and air freight. Let’s begin!  

## Freight Shipping Definition 

The objective of freight shipping is to take your freight from point A to point B. However, there are some factors to consider before figuring out which mode is best for you: 

* Delivery speed 
* Weight and dimensions of freight 
* Pricing 
* Coverage 

## Freight Shipping Methods 

Here are some of the most common freight shipping methods used by entrepreneurs and business owners: 

### Less than Truckload (LTL)

LTL shipping refers to cargo that is larger than a standard parcel but cannot fill up the space of one trailer. This shipping type is the most popular as it’s the most affordable and accessible service. 

LTL generally uses trucks that contain an assortment of goods to be delivered to different destinations along a single route. These shipments typically weigh between 150 to 15,000 pounds. 

### Full Truckload (FTL) 

Shippers may also book a full truckload capacity. FTL involves moving unpackaged bulk or pallet loads, typically weighing over 10,000 pounds. Generally, these commodities require climate or temperature control, flatbeds, or have other special considerations. 

FTL is the most efficient ground freight as there is only one destination. It is the most popular choice for important and urgent shipments. 

### Air Freight 

The fastest shipping method is by air, but it’s also the most expensive. It is generally preferred for fragile and valuable shipments, such as electronics. Examples of large air freight companies are UPS and FedEx. Shippers can opt for either express or standard air freight. 

### Marine Freight 

This method is the most common international freight shipping method because of its extremely low cost. It’s the most preferred method for low-urgency bulk international goods. Shippers can opt for: 

* *FTL marine freight:* more efficient 
* *LCL marine freight:* cost-effective and eco-friendly 

Next, let’s take a look at the benefits of freight shipping.
