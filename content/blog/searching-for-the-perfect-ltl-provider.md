The search for a new LTL provider can often be a daunting task leaving you feeling overwhelmed. Whether you’re making the change from bad past experience, or it’s your first time, it can be a challenge. Just like any [service](https://www.goship.com/blog/benefits-of-using-an-online-shipping-service/), none are created equal and each company has its own strengths and weaknesses. Many companies offer similar services with similar pricing, but the price should not be the only deciding factor. Finding the right LTL provider can mean the difference between deliveries showing up on time and intact or not showing up at all.

**So, how do you find the perfect LTL provider that you need?**
---------------------------------------------------------------

Most shippers are looking strictly at price when choosing their carrier. But the best way to find a carrier is word of mouth. Ask around and find out who others are using. Reach out to networking groups and source other opinions from local sources. If you want to find one that you plan to use as your primary, consider contacting the sales representative. Another great method is to do your homework online. The internet is one of your greatest assets. You can research the provider and see what they offer directly. You can see if anyone else has used them and what their experience was like. Viewing the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/) on that provider is also a wise decision. You want to ensure they have a good reputation before placing your trust in their hands.

**Four factors to consider for LTL providers:**
-----------------------------------------------

### **Are their rates comparable to the industry standards?**

The saying is true when you hear “you get what you pay for”. A low price may mean a low quality service. A high price could mean high-quality service. Make sure they have a reason for their pricing before jumping to an assumption over their enticing prices.

### **What services do they offer?**

Plenty of providers give options such as a front door or loading bay delivery, but some offer additional non-standard options for special requests. It’s good to have your options open if you have special requirements. Some even give options such as the ability to reserve sealed trailer space (for example, walled off sections or special configurations).

### **What region do they cover?**

Many providers may not have the reach you need when shipping. Make sure to view their coverage so that you don’t see any surprising costs stack on your bill from a truck transfer. When a distance can’t be completed by one provider, they often have to involve another provider which is where that cost can arrive from.

### **Do they guarantee service?**

Some providers offer shippers a money-back assurance that they will meet the service expectations. This is often provided for a nominal fee.
