## Steps to Securely Pack Your Fragile Items for Shipping

To properly pack and prepare your fragile items for shipping, it is important to follow the packaging strategy that allows you to securely ship your cargo.

### 1. Choose a durable and properly sized box

Ensure that the box fits tightly around your item but is large enough to accommodate packing material. It should also be sturdy enough to support the weight of your items.

### 2. Double box delicate items 

When dealing with extremely fragile items, make sure to double-box the items within a larger box. Place the smaller parcel in the middle of the larger box. There should be at least 3-inches of cushioning in and around the smaller box.

### 3. Pack fragile items individually 

For especially delicate items, wrap each one in at least three inches of air cellular cushioning. You can also consider applying additional layers of packaging materials or void fillers.

### 4. Restrict movement

It’s critical to find the right amount of cushioning and the correct placement to ensure that your product withstands all sorts of delivery handling. Place the fragile item in the middle of the box and cover it with ample cushioning on all sides. You can use packing peanuts, airbags, and crumpled newspapers to prevent it from moving around.

### 6. Seal tightly

Ensure that you close the box and seal it tightly with packing tape. Ideally, you should tape it over multiple times to ensure that it stays secure during transport.

### 7. Place the shipping label properly

Remember to place the shipping label on the parcel’s large surface. This ensures that your package stays current ends up in transit. Avoid placing the label on taped seams.  Avoid writing “fragile” on your package as well.
