Shipping can be stressful, especially if it involves fragile items! You’ll be holding your breath from the moment your package leaves your doorstep up until it reaches its final destination. Businesses are especially careful about damaged items since it’s more likely that you’ll bear the brunt of the damage. Nobody wants to deal with unhappy customers either. Delicate and fragile items, like glassware or antiques, need extra attention, so be prepared to pack and ship them properly.  Using the right packing materials, learning how to protect fragile items, and learning the best way to ship items domestically and overseas will ensure happy customers and a less stressful situation for you.

## What is the best packing material for fragile items?

We’d go as far as to say that your choice of packing material plays one of the biggest roles in protecting your items. Here are some of the top choices for packing materials:

- Properly sized and durable box: Extremely important to find the right dimensions that maintain a snug fit around your fragile items plus packaging material.
- Packing tape: very useful for securing boxes and packing materials.
- Bubble wrap: a reliable way to protect delicate items. Multiple layers can be used for extra protection.
- Airbags: great for filling up empty spaces in a box. Ideal for sharp edges.
- Foam enclosures: molded specifically for the product you’re shipping
- Packing peanuts: ensure that there is no extra space in the box for the item to move around.
- Crumpled paper: for an eco-friendly and affordable option, crumpled up paper does a great job filling up gaps in your shipment box. For best results, insert two inches of crumpled-up paper between the fragile item and the wall of the box.
- Foam-in-bag: spray foam that molds around an item. Comes in different densities.
- Corrugated inserts: used to strengthen the package and increase durability.

## Steps for Packing Fragile Items 

### 1. Choose a durable and properly sized box

Ensure that the box fits tightly around your item but is large enough to accommodate packing material. It should also be sturdy enough to support the weight of your items.

### 2. Double box delicate items 

When dealing with extremely fragile items, make sure to double-box the items within a larger box. Place the smaller parcel in the middle of the larger box. There should be at least 3-inches of cushioning in and around the smaller box.

### 3. Pack fragile items individually 

For especially delicate items, wrap each one in at least three inches of air cellular cushioning.

### 4. Restrict movement

It’s critical to find the right amount of cushioning and the correct placement to ensure that your product withstands all sorts of delivery handling. Place the fragile item in the middle of the box and cover it with ample cushioning on all sides. You can use packing peanuts, airbags, and crumpled newspapers to prevent it from moving around.

### 5. Strengthen the box

Use craft paper or corrugated inserts to strengthen the walls of your box…

### 6. Seal tightly

Ensure that you close the box and seal it tightly with packing tape. Ideally, you should tape it over multiple times to ensure that it stays secure during transport.

### 7. Place the shipping label properly

Remember to place the shipping label on the parcel’s large surface. This ensures that your package stays the current end up in transit. Avoid placing the label on taped seams.  Avoid writing “fragile” on your package as well.
