title: Sustainable Freight Shipping Ideas for the Future
intro: "The shipping industry will be facing many rapid changes in the near
  future. One change, in particular, is to be more sustainable. We have already
  seen efforts by companies to “go green” and make drastic changes to address
  climate change. New studies on climate change have promoted businesses all
  over the world to take measures for reducing the carbon footprint and turn to
  sustainable shipping. Right now, the trucking industry is far from the “green”
  industry that authorities are looking for and hoping for. "

The shipping industry expects to face many challenges connected to sustainability. It mainly concerns the expanding environmental issues that modify the way we manage the supply chain processes. New climate studies have encouraged businesses to reduce their carbon footprint and turn to sustainable freight shipping, which results in companies making efforts to go green and address climate change.



# Why is green shipping important?



Adopting a green shipping strategy is an excellent step toward upgrading the overall logistics processes and optimizing your supply chain. Thanks to the innovations created to maintain eco-friendly programs, you can get familiar with various [technological advances](https://www.goship.com/posts/latest-technological-innovations-in-the-logistics-industry) and tools to facilitate logistics operations. Besides, sustainable shipping can help you save costs on different levels, from using alternative power sources to cutting off the excessive paperwork routine and digitalizing it.

Sustainable freight shipping enhances your logistics performance, but it also helps you grow customer loyalty. Numerous studies show that [more than half of consumers](https://www.fooddive.com/news/consumer-demand-for-sustainable-packaging-holds-despite-pandemic/599013/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20(54%25),to%2070%25%20of%20all%20consumers.) pay attention to packaging composition and the company’s direction towards sustainability. Since the percentage of people concerned about the state of the environment constantly grows, it’s vital to meet their expectations and contribute to the plastics reduction.



## How can truck drivers help the environment?



The trucking industry is constantly looking for ways to realization of [green initiatives](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-shippers-can-support-green-shipping). Trucks cover thousands of miles every day, polluting the air with CO2 and using large amounts of fuel and oil. Although these changes may take a while for companies to adapt to, there are a few ways that truckers and companies can use to impact the environment positively.



Sometimes, it’s hard to control the environmental impact on the road. Drivers have to stay concentrated to complete their deliveries on time, avoiding possible disruptions. The emissions level can’t be their primary concern, but there are some easy steps every driver can take to decrease the harmful effects of shipping:



* Driving at slower speeds can significantly lower the truck's emissions. If drivers reduce their speed by as little as five miles per hour, they can decrease the risk of accidents and lower their overall fuel consumption. If the delivery deadlines aren’t too tight, the speed reduction can be a reasonable option for practicing [green shipping](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-to-become-an-eco-friendly-business-green-logistics-tips).



* Taking time when starting, stopping, and switching the truck speed can lower fuel consumption by 5 – 10%. If the situation allows, it’s better to do all these actions more carefully, thus ensuring better and longer-lasting operation of your truck. 



* Drivers can use truck stop electrification when sleeping in their cabins for heating and cooling instead of relying on diesel. It can help reduce diesel emissions and save on fuel costs. Besides, electrification is safer during extended downtime, primarily for the driver and the vehicle.



* Regular truck inspections will help detect and prevent possible problems resulting in high fuel consumption and emission levels. Checking your transport units can keep you from fuel wastage and prolong the life of your truck.



## How can companies help the environment?



If you decide to engage in environmentally friendly operations at a company scale, it gives you a more comprehensive range of options that can bring you many benefits later. Adopting a sustainable shipping strategy improves the quality of your supply chain and helps to save costs effectively. For example:



* One of the most straightforward steps is to replace your regular packaging with a more sustainable type. Try to avoid plastic packaging and see if there’s a possibility of reusing or recycling it. The market offers plenty of [organic packaging](https://www.goship.com/posts/sustainable-strategy-eco-friendly-packaging) that’s often cheaper than artificial materials.



* You can look to improve fuel technology and efficiency by utilizing alternative substances and hybrid technology. If you don’t have an opportunity to ship the goods by electric transport, you can choose a sustainable fuel that suits your transport units.



* Route planning is one of the best choices to cut your wasted and escape heavy traffic. You can also shorten the downtime and deliver your products faster by optimizing the routes.



* Investing in new technologies can lower operating costs and improve fuel efficiency. New technology includes computer-controlled engines, radio or heating, and cooling innovations. If you ship temperature-sensitive items in [reefer trucks](https://www.goship.com/posts/what-is-refrigerated-shipping-and-how-does-it-work), modern digital systems can regulate the temperature in a way it wastes less fuel.



* Companies can start using various sustainable equipment that’s both eco-friendly and affordable. For instance, you can think about applying aerodynamic panels, wide-base tires, low viscosity lubricants, exhaust system upgrades, auxiliary power units (APUs), eco-flaps, and electric forklifts. All these innovations have already become accessible for small businesses and aim to increase the popularity of alternative energy sources.
