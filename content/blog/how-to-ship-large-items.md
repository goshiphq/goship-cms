The market today offers numerous transportation options to shippers of all scales.

Still, there are many reliable and affordable shipping platforms that can handle your delivery according to all your transportation needs.

## What shipment is considered large?

There are two main categories of shipments: parcel and freight. Large items are classified as freight since they cannot be shipped as normal packages through the mail. Are there any size limits that distinguish these two categories? Particularly, the dimensional weight of your cargo defines the transportation mode you are most likely to use. For most parcel shipping services, if your shipment weighs more than 150 lbs, exceeds 108 inches in length, and 165 inches in girth, it’s probably considered a freight shipment. While some parcel services do freight shipping, the price is often higher than specialized freight carriers would charge. So, if your shipment classifies as freight, [parcel shipping services](https://www.goship.com/posts/understanding-ltl-and-parcel-shipping-what-is-best-for-my-small-business1) won't represent the cheapest way to ship a package of large size.

## How to ship large packages?

## How much does shipping large items cost?

The final shipping cost depends on many factors, like dimensions, weight, destination, transit times, type of carrier, etc. To fully understand how much shipping large items costs, consider the main factors that impact them.

It may seem unusual, but dense shipments are cheaper to send. The denser your load is, the less it is prone to damage during transit, and the safer it looks for the carrier.

### **Dimensions**

Shipment dimensions are important since it determines the space your load will take up in the trailer. Also, carriers and shipping services will pay attention to the stackability and shape of the load - the easier it is to stack, the lower the price is.

Certain periods during a year can affect the prices for shipping oversized items. For example, moving large parts in terms of the [busy holiday season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-for-peak-season-shipping) will increase your expenses.
