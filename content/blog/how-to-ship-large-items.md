Shipping large and oversize packages
------------------------------------

The market today offers numerous transportation options to shippers. However, if you are a newcomer to the industry, you may find shipping prices confusing, especially when you need to ship large items. If your shipment is heavier than 70 lbs, it may be difficult to find the cheapest way to ship large packages. If you want to ship appliances, machinery, or a large volume of goods, it's likely that your shipment won’t fit into standard parcel shipping. There are many reliable and affordable [shipping platforms](https://www.goship.com/blog/top-3-benefits-of-using-an-online-shipping-solution/) that can be helpful.

What is a large shipment? What is the difference between parcel and freight shipping?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two main categories of shipments: parcel and freight. Large items are classified as freight since they cannot be shipped as normal packages through the mail. Are there any size limits that distinguish these two categories? Particularly, yes. For most parcel shipping services, if your shipment weighs more than 150 lbs, exceeds 108 inches in length and 165 inches in girth, it’s probably considered as freight shipment. While some parcel services do freight shipping, the price is often higher than specialized freight carriers would charge. So, if your shipment classifies as freight, it’s better to consider other options than just parcel shipping services.

What is the best way to ship large and heavy items?

There are many different transportation modes available for moving freight. Depending on the shipment’s volume and size, it can be moved through [two shipping modes](https://www.goship.com/blog/full-truckload-vs-less-than-truckload-what-is-the-difference/): full truckload and or less-than-truckload. The less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping mode is the most popular way to ship goods at a reasonable price. LTL suggests your items are large, yet don't require a full trailer. This allows you to share shipping costs with other shippers whose freight is combined with yours in one truckload.

Here are 3 steps to successfully ship heavy items:
--------------------------------------------------

### Collect accurate information about the shipment

Make sure you’ve measured your freight correctly, as this information impacts shipping cost. Weight, dimensions, addresses, [freight class](https://www.goship.com/blog/blog-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ltl-freight-class/), additional shipment descriptions, and required services – all this data will impact the ultimate shipping cost. It’s crucial to provide accurate information to avoid shipping disruptions and unwanted fees.

### Choose a convenient shipping service

Online shipping services will often simplify the entire process for you. A good shipping company should have a wide network of carriers, provide shipping rates, and assist you in arranging the shipment. If you already have information about your shipment, you can enter all of the information in for a quote to see what the best options are for you.

### Go ahead and ship!

Once you’ve chosen a shipping partner, provide them with all the necessary information stated above. If there are any questions or concerns, contact the company directly to manage all the details. Arrange pickup and delivery time, and you’re good to go!

How much does shipping large items cost?
----------------------------------------

There’s no fixed price for shipping freight, as every piece is different. The final shipping cost depends on many factors, like dimensions, weight, destination, transit times, type of carrier, etc. To fully understand how much shipping large items costs, let’s go over that main factors that impact it:

### **Density**

It may seem unusual, but dense shipments are cheaper to send. The denser your load is, the less it is prone to damage during transit, and the safer it looks for the carrier. Loose or fragile items can be way more expensive to move than heavy and dense items.

### **Weight**

Weight is a major contributor to your shipping cost. The most important thing here is to provide accurate information because any errors can result in additional charges.

### **Dimensions**

Shipment dimensions are important since it determines the space your load will take up in the trailer. Also, carriers and shipping services will pay attention to the stackability and shape of the load - the easier it is to stack, the lower the price is.

### **Freight class**

Freight class is a special classification developed by the [National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA)](http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc) to ease cargo shipping pricing. There are 18 classes, ranging from 50 to 500. Each of them has a specific code that applies to a certain type of freight.

### **Destination**

Obviously, mileage plays a role in determining the final shipping price. The longer the route, the more you will pay. Additionally, there is such a thing as limited access shipping, which is a location or area that is hard for the carrier to reach or to unload. This often confuses shippers because a limited access location can be a residence or another place that is considered a normal location by the shipper. You can read the list of GoShip.com’s limited locations [here](https://www.goship.com/blog/limited-access-shipping-location/). However, at GoShip.com, you can easily compare prices on our platform.
