The unexpected wave of the coronavirus is affecting the world’s economy beyond belief, causing business owners panic. Certain businesses that were most affected, like restaurants, bars, catering, etc, have already started laying off their workforce. It is a huge challenge for both employees and small businesses, however, the freezing period does not necessarily mean that it is over for your business. One of the most important orders for businesses right now is to [properly communicate](https://hbr.org/2020/03/communicating-through-the-coronavirus-crisis) the pandemic situation to their customers. 

How do you communicate with your customers during the COVID-19 pandemic?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create an emergency plan 

Regardless of the size of your business, it is important to give a response to the critical situation, without being reserved. Many businesses are forced to shut down, but this doesn’t mean it is over for you. Don’t be too quick to let your employees go. Sit down with your team and develop a plan. Where can you cut costs? Which areas of your business will be most affected, and which can survive? Are there any opportunities to find and use in the time of crisis? Restaurants and cafés were the first to be affected and forced to close from the coronavirus spreading, but many found a solution to leave drive-through's open, serve takeout, or provide doorstep delivery. Try to rationally analyze every branch of your business and make decisions considering a long-term perspective. The storm will end, but you will need workers, customers, and your company. 

### Communicate honestly with your customers

Crashing is the last thing you want your customers to see as a business. While you have to join forces and make challenging decisions to stay on the market, it’s important to keep your customers in the loop. Give them quick and clear updates on how your regular operations have changed: schedule, location, alternative service options, etc. The best thing you can do is to present the new working model you will be operating under and reassure your audience that they will still have the same quality and service. Right now, it isn't just you who is worried. Your customers are confused too, and figuring out their needs can open a window for you to still serve them, just in a different way.

### Develop special offers and discounts

Special offers do not necessarily mean desperately selling out all of your products. Keep in mind that thousands of people on quarantine are bored and crave entertainment. It is a great time to entertain your customers: provide e-gift cards, build an online communication strategy, etc.  In this tough time, GoShip.com still ships you freight with the highest quality of service.
