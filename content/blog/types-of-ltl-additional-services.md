What are additional LTL services?
---------------------------------

Additional LTL services are extra service offers for an added fee to satisfy the shipper’s needs. When shipping less-than-truckload, clear communication between the consignee and the carrier is crucial for a successful shipping process. It is very important for the shipper to know how the entire process after delivery will look.  LTL shipping is comparably low-priced, however, it has many additional services that may [add up to the final shipping cost](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-avoid-unwanted-shipping-costs/). Essentially, the definition of an additional service [varies from carrier to carrier,](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-ltl-carriers/) but knowing the very basics of the additional services in LTL will help you avoid misunderstandings and money losses. 

What are the types of additional LTL services? 
-----------------------------------------------

### Lift gate service at pickup/delivery

The lift gate is a piece of special equipment at the rear of the truck used to simplify loading and unloading. If you do not need this service, notify your carrier about it since most carriers offer it. A lift gate is needed for almost every residential delivery, but make sure to discuss it before scheduling a shipment. 

### Inside pickup/delivery

[Inside delivery](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-inside-delivery/) is when your freight is delivered right to the door of your facility or residence. There are two main types of inside delivery: residential and commercial. It is a tricky service because many shippers mistakenly assume that the driver will normally leave freight somewhere near the building, but it’s not always like that. If you don't request inside delivery, the driver will just leave the shipment at the exact same place where it was unloaded from the truck. Therefore, it is important for you to talk about this aspect with your carrier to avoid confusion. 

### Delivery appointment

A delivery appointment is the agreed time and date of freight arrival between the receiver and the carrier. This option is common when you ship to a warehouse or facility that has strict delivery schedules. 

### Limited access shipping 

Despite that shippers often think remote areas are something like mountain villages, the limited access category actually [covers a substantial number of locations](https://www.goship.com/blog/limited-access-shipping-location/) like private houses, schools, churches, etc. It is important to define if your delivery access is considered remote by the carrier. 

### Trade show

Exhibition, or [trade show shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/trade-show-shipping-3-things-to-know/), is a special type of service where freight is delivered to and from a certain location. Most carriers classify trade show shipment with [freight class](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/national-training-center/search-classes) 125 regardless of what you are shipping. 

### Detention

The suggested free time that a driver can spend at the delivery address after unloading is 30 minutes. After that time, additional charges may be applied.  So, the next time you schedule a shipment, discuss all the details in advance. The basic understanding of additional services and proper communication will help you avoid extra fees and have a positive shipping experience.  [![](https://www.goship.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1ace89b4-fe28-40ff-a2a7-4cddc60fc9ec.png)](https://www.goship.com/)
