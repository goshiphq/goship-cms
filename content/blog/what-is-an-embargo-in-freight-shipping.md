Logistics operations are often regulated by economic sanctions that can significantly affect global shipping processes. Embargoes are one of the influential freight shipping factors that you need to get familiar with.

# What Is An Embargo?

An embargo is any event or government restriction that prevents commerce or exchange (import or export) of freight to another country or state.  The embargo can be applied to different types of goods including:

* Services
* Products
* Currency

Embargo in freight shipping can be imposed in any historical context, as it covers all aspects of economic activity and trade. Generally, restrictions do not apply to the exchange of all goods. A specific embargo is usually applied to certain categories of transport, goods, and services. More commonly, restraints refer to military equipment and oil embargo. In international relations and foreign policy, these trade sanctions can be a result of diplomatic, unfavorable political, economic, financial, technical, and scientific pressure.

## What Are the Types of Embargoes? 

There are several types of embargoes that can be imposed on a country or state. These can be total or partial in nature. Some common embargoes are:

* Political embargo 
* Embargo to ensure national security
* Trade embargo or embargo that is economic in nature are used to stunt the economic growth of countries
* Embargo to prevent and respond to disputes about territorial borders
* Embargo to protect the health of citizens
* Environmental embargo to express a country’s disagreement with another country’s environmental or animal welfare policy

Certain trade embargoes will still allow the exchange of specific goods such as medicine or food to meet humanitarian needs. Most multinational sanctions have provisions that allow certain import and export services under a set of restrictions.

## Why Are Freight Embargoes Imposed? 

Both in historical and modern cases, embargoes have been established on foreign trade due to various reasons. It is most commonly directed to a specific country or group of countries that pose a threat to international security. The imposed trade restrictions are used as a basis for terminating or suspending all activities related to the obligations of specific countries, citizens, and their organizations. An embargo is a powerful instrument that has the potential to affect a country or state in terms of political and economic aspects. Imposing an embargo on a certain country means that they can no longer utilize their economic resources for trade to their full capacity. This will have adverse effects on economic prosperity.

## Why Do Carriers Implement LTL Embargoes?

LTL embargoes are restrictions applied by carriers in terms of complicated shipping circumstances that considerably cut their transportation capacity. It is usually caused by [peak shipping season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-your-small-business-for-peak-shipping-season), [bad weather conditions](https://www.goship.com/posts/winter-shipping-tips-stay-ahead-storm), or [limited access](https://www.goship.com/posts/limited-access-shipping-location) to certain locations. That is if the carrier cannot currently accommodate the volume of your freight, or is unable to meet the delivery deadlines, they may apply some limitations which won't affect you as a supplier. In this case, lifting the embargo is possible if the carrier obtains the required capacity and gets back to competitive shipping.

Besides, freight carriers can implement economic sanctions in relation to specific geographic regions or products that are restricted from shipping by the [US Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information). This is the type of economic embargo that cannot be ignored or avoided.

## What Are the Consequences of LTL Freight Embargoes?

When you are trying to meet a growing customers' demand and deliver their orders with no disruptions, shipping embargoes can become a stumbling block. Consequently, restrictions implemented by freight carriers can lead to a harmful impact on the supply chain process.

### Tight capacity

When shipping from embargoed areas or in terms of the busy season, you may struggle while looking for the carrier to deliver your items. Be prepared for the tight carrier capacity and try to schedule your shipments in advance if possible.

### Shipping delays

Carriers who accept embargoed items will likely take on more freight than usual, causing inevitable shipping delays. In addition, if the speed of your supply chain has been affected by a range of external factors, it is better to notify your customers about a longer than usual waiting time.

### Increased freight rates

When a carrier imposes an embargo on a location that you commonly import or export from, you may have to look for a more expensive carrier company to complete the delivery. Same way, if the carrier capacity is tight due to extremely high demand, the[ freight rates](https://www.goship.com/posts/how-are-truckload-freight-rates-calculated) will definitely increase.
