Shipping can be a [costly task](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-avoid-unwanted-shipping-costs/) that may put you off-budget, but there are ways to make sure you keep your costs in check. If it’s your first time or fiftieth time, we have compiled a list for you to help you reduce shipping costs to a minimum.

**Choosing your provider**
--------------------------

Using a [reliable provider](https://www.goship.com/blog/questions-to-ask-your-ltl-shipping-provider/) for your freight transportation is crucial to reduce shipping costs. A good provider would have a large list of carriers across the region they service.

**Research carriers**
---------------------

It is always best to understand your carrier options when planning a shipment. Each carrier has its own characteristics (i.e. region, item preference, and size/weight limit). Knowing what each carrier is best at can ensure your freight is accommodated properly. Working within their region will prevent costs associated with passing a load off to another carrier.

**Plan to ship on peak days**
-----------------------------

Peak days to ship are typically the start of the week (Mondays and Tuesdays). Most businesses like to receive their products by Wednesday and Friday to ensure they have products constantly in stock for the weekend. That being said, you don’t want to ship when carriers are finishing up their load. Get it out early and fast.

**Ship closer, not further**
----------------------------

If you’re going the extra mile and shipping across the country, expect to pay more than if you only had to ship across town. If you're shipping remotely, be prepared to see a higher cost. Consider shipping from a more central location or a prime hub to make it easier for the carrier to pick up the shipment.

**Package efficiently**
-----------------------

Packing your item with less bulk is ideal. If you can reduce the amount of space in your shipment, you could allow more items to be allocated. Consider shrink wrap after you compiled your shipment to help keep everything together. Make sure your [shipment is safe](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-safely-prepare-your-ltl-freight-shipment/) so you can avoid damages that may cost you money.

**Palletizing and stacking**
----------------------------

Placing your freight on a pallet makes loading and unloading more efficient for the carrier. Efficiency will help to keep your costs low and save the carrier time – a win for both parties. Pallets also help with protecting your items as they can be secured confidently. If your freight can be stacked, you can reduce the amount of unused space within the trailer, increasing the number of loads that can be added.

**Record accurate dimensions**
------------------------------

Knowing the size and weight of your freight is important to both you and your carrier. The more [accuracy in your dimensions](https://www.goship.com/blog/factors-determine-ltl-shipping-rates/), the better the carrier can plan its shipments. If your dimensions are incorrect, your carrier will have to recalculate what they can fit which would incur additional costs.

**Understand your freight class**
---------------------------------

Freight class helps the carrier to understand the load better. Your freight class will tell the carrier about the weight and density of an item. If the item is dense and light, you will have a lower cost because it is easier to handle and harder to break.

**Have proper documentation**
-----------------------------

Always make sure your paperwork is filled out correctly and clearly. You want to make sure the carrier can see how and where the shipment is being delivered. A bill of lading is essential to have on the outside of your shipment where your carrier can access it. Improper documentation can lead to research costs or incorrect delivery.

**Only use what you need**
--------------------------

If you’re looking to add any accessorials, try to keep them to a minimum if you can. They will increase your cost to ship. If you don’t need them, why add them? Get your [Free Quote](https://app.goship.com/#/wizard) to understand how much GoShip.com can help save you on your shipping costs.
