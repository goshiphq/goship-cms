# How to choose a trailer?

There are different trailers in truckload shipping, each created to move different kinds of freight. Before booking a shipment, it’s crucial to know the differences between truck trailers, their roles, and specifics. It is critical to examine your cargo in detail and understand its size and dimensions to pick the most suitable trailer type.

Determining your product type will help the carrier company select the vehicle for you and meet your transit expectations.
