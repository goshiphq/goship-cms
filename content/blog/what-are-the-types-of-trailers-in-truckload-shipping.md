If you don’t have a lot of experience with [truckload freight shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-truckload-shipping-and-how-does-it-work/), it may be challenging to arrange everything properly. While many shippers are focused on freight rates, they often miss the importance of using the correct equipment. There are different types of trailers in truckload shipping, each created to move different types of freight. Before booking a shipment, it’s crucial to know what are the differences between truck trailers, their role, and their characteristics.

## What are the types of trailers?

## Dry van trailer

[Dry vans](https://www.plslogistics.com/blog/dry-van-shipping-8-facts/) are the stars of the truckload freight shipping industry, as this is the most commonly used type of freight shipping equipment. They are called ‘dry’ because shippers move their dry freight, which means goods that don't require temperature control. Dry van trailers are enclosed boxes that are fully protected from external influence. They basically work for everything except perishable and oversized freight.

### The most frequently moved commodities:

* Clothing, fabrics, textile
* Electronics and machinery
* Consumer packaged goods
* Non-perishable food and beverages
* Retail products

### Dry van trailer dimensions:

Length: 28, 32, 36, 40, 42, 43, 45, 48, 53 feet Widths: 96 – 102 inches Height: 12.5 – 13.5 feet

## Refrigerated trailers

In a nutshell, [refrigerated trailers](https://www.plslogistics.com/blog/refrigerated-shipping-trailers-7-facts/), or reefers, are just refrigerators on wheels. On the outside, they look like dry van trailers but have built-in climate control systems inside to maintain a certain temperature during transit. It’s not hard to guess that reefers typically move perishable products.

### The most frequently moved commodities:

* Perishable food and beverages
* Flowers
* Pharmaceuticals
* Fine art products

### Refrigerated trailer dimensions:

Length: 28, 32, 36, 40, 48, 51, 53 feet Widths: 96 – 102 inches Height: 12.5 – 13.5 feet

## Flatbed trailer

Flatbed is an open trailer with sides but with no roof, and a special deck to load freight. Essentially, flatbeds won’t work if your freight is sensitive to wind or rain, because these trailers don’t provide the protection like dry vans. However, a [flatbed shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-flatbed-shipping/) may be the only valid solution for oversized freight. These trailers handle cargo of irregular shape and size and are in high demand among industrial shippers.

### The most frequently moved commodities:

* Oversized machinery
* Industrial equipment
* Steel products, pipes, and rigs
* Aircraft, engines

### Flatbed trailer dimensions:

Length: 40, 42, 45, 48, 53 feet Widths: 102 inches Height: 58 – 62 inches Now when you know all the main trailer types, you’re good to arrange a shipment and choose the right equipment for your freight!
