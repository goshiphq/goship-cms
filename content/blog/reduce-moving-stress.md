Sometimes organizing the moving process can be stressful, and it may often seem like an ongoing to-do list.  There are many different things to keep track of during a big move and make it highly successful.



# Biggest moving challenges



Stressing out because of the moving is natural since you’ve got to create a detailed action plan. Typically starting with simply packing your items, you also need to research suitable services that can help you safely move all your stuff to the destination. This question involves appropriate items’ containment and reliable transportation avoiding possible disruptions.



Moving to a new place requires thorough preparation and intense planning activities. Often, people get confused over the number of steps needed to organize the procedure of transporting many objects due to the diversity of their shapes, sizes, and other features. However, professional shipping services can provide practical solutions to any moving issues. 



## How to organize the moving process?



Changing the residence location is multicomponent and needs you to plan every step of this process. It can be overwhelming, but proper preparation and choosing a reliable carrier can do the thing for you. Below are some helpful tips to help make your move a smooth transition and less stressful.



### Stay ahead



It is always a good idea to start earlier than necessary to ensure that you have cushion time at the beginning of your shipment. Giving yourself enough time and getting ahead in the moving process can help alleviate stress and plan for unexpected delays. 



Try to determine suitable dates for your move, and control your activities according to the set timeline. While gathering the objects may be quite fast, finding the shipping service can take more time. Strong time management will allow you to book shipments at better rates, thus saving your costs.



### Plan and stay organized



Packing without a plan is inefficient and can make the packing process much more difficult. Creating a plan to go through all of your items can help you stay organized and save time checking items off your list. It is always a great idea to de-clutter during a move to eliminate unnecessary items and help slim down the number of things you are moving.



In addition, try to pack your items properly so they go through the shipment safely. While you’d pack stackable things in regular crates, [fragile objects](https://stg.goship.tin.gg/blog/how-to-pack-ship-fragile-items-properly-top-5-tips/) would need additional shockproof materials inside the box. Most furniture demands reassembling and sealing separate parts in separate packages.



### Create a backup plan



In an ideal world, everything would go smoothly during a big move. Unfortunately, people often run into minor setbacks at some point during a move. It is always good to have a backup plan if something doesn’t go as expected. 



Getting [freight insurance](https://goship.com/blog/what-is-freight-insurance-and-why-do-shippers-need-it/) will keep you more relaxed during the stressful parts of the move. Sometimes, shipping disruptions are uncontrollable and lead to damaging some of your items. You’ll prevent financial losses and undoubtedly receive compensation by insuring the most valuable objects.



### Research your new residence



Before you move, try to learn more information about the neighborhood, events, activities, entertainment, and restaurants in the new town or area. Being familiar with the site will help you relax during the move and be excited about the new things to do at your new location. 



To make things easier once you arrive, identify the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, gas station, and other critical nearby shops that you will frequently be using. Every move is bound to be stressful, but there are many ways to stay calm and cope with the transition. Using a reliable shipping or moving company can help make your moving process as easy as possible.



### Hire professionals



It is often easiest to hire an experienced company to help pack your stuff, move it to the new location and unload it. It also guarantees the integrity of your items and their resistance to the threat of damage during transportation. Hiring [professional helpers](https://goship.com/task-rabbit/) can make a move more manageable and allow you to focus on other vital parts of the [](https://www.goship.com/posts/tips-and-tricks-to-successfully-move-cross-country) moving process.



It’s vital to remember that sometimes your items may arrive at different times depending on their weight, size, and shipping requirements that apply to the essential characteristics of the cargo. For example, regulations for [moving electronics](https://goship.com/industries/electronics/) differ from those relating to [moving furniture](https://goship.com/industries/furniture/) objects. Thus, consider cooperating with a reliable carrier who can meet your shipping needs and even consult you on the specifics of the logistics process.



If you plan to move large items, think about working with full truckload (FTL) carriers that can provide you with an entire truck space and deliver your things on a tight deadline. Equally, if your cargo is relatively boxy, you can use the option of less than truckload (LTL) trucking and make your moving process more affordable. GoShip can connect you to a wide range of reliable carrier services that provide LTL quotes at the best rates. Try our simple online tool to [get a free quote](https://goship.com/) in a minute!
