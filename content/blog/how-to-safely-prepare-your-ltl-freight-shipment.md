# Preparing for LTL shipping

Since your cargo might not be sizeable and the delivery deadlines aren’t too tight, it’s reasonable to get involved in [LTL shipping](https://goship.com/blog/how-ltl-freight-shipping-can-help-with-small-business-shipping/). This logistics mode allows you to share the truck space with other customers, thus effectively saving your shipping costs. Nonetheless, you’ve got to take care of reliable packaging to prevent freight damage.

## How to pack LTL shipments?



It is vital to package and prepare your shipment correctly to ensure the freight’s safety during transportation. Several basic steps will help you prepare your items for shipping and stay confident about their quality.

### Step one



Palletizing is undoubtedly one of the best ways to secure the load and prevent it from moving inside the truck. The first step you want to take in packing your supplies is picking the right pallet for your needs. Due to the wide choice of [shipping pallets](https://goship.com/blog/palletizing-ltl-freight-everything-you-need-to-know/), you can easily find the appropriate options.



When shipping [oversized items](https://goship.com/blog/how-to-safely-ship-oversized-items-everything-you-need-to-know/), you’ll probably want a large pallet sturdy enough to endure your freight’s weight. In this case, consider choosing wooden pallets that are firm and reusable. If shipping more miniature goods condensed into crates, you can pick wooden and plastic pallets that will keep the boxes together during transit.



### Step two



When preparing the LTL shipment, pay attention to your freight’s stackability. This feature influences the [density](https://goship.com/blog/how-does-density-affect-ltl-shipping/) of the cargo and consequently affects shipping prices. Try to identify whether you can stack all of your crates on a pallet or if you need to place the shipment more spatially.



You will want to consider the best way to stack your products or supplies on the pallet. Depending on what you are shipping, the best way to do this is by purchasing angular cartons that you can stack in an interlocking/column method. If you are shipping with bags, you will want to stack them as best as possible with a cardboard protector on top and the bottom.



If shipping [fragile objects](https://goship.com/blog/best-practices-to-properly-pack-and-ship-fragile-items/), pay attention to special requirements for their stackability. Since fragile items are more prone to transportation damage, consider adding cushion materials to prevent that. They will keep your products from kicking inside the box or hitting other articles.



### Step three



Before sending your shipment, you’ll want to secure the stacked cartons or bags to the pallet. You can do this by using strapping or stretch wrapping. This rule primarily applies to disassembled items that you pack into separate boxes. Try to locate crates with furniture or electronics pieces on the same pallet and strap them to avoid the items’ loss or misplacement.



Scratch wrapping will protect the cargo pieces from falling out of the crate. Knowing that the LTL supply chain implies delivering several shipments from different owners, it’d be hard to look for missed items in the transit process.

### Step four



You need to put an exact destination address on your package to ship your item successfully. The more visible and apparent your labeling is, the easier your package reaches its receiver. Besides, it’s vital to include short descriptions of shipped items. It will streamline shipping operations and help carriers to go through inspections.
