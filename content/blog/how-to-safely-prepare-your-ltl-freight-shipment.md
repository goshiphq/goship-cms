How to pack LTL freight shipment?
---------------------------------

### Step One:

The first step you want to take in packing your supplies is in choosing the right pallet for your needs. You want a pallet large and sturdy enough so that your supplies fit properly on the pallet.

### Step Two:

You will want to consider the best way to stack your products or supplies on the pallet itself. Depending on what you are shipping, the best way to do this is by purchasing angular cartons that can be stacked in an interlocking/column method. If you are shipping with bags, you will want to stack them as best as you can with a cardboard protector on top and on the bottom.

### Step Three:

Before you send your shipment, you will want to secure the stacked cartons or bags to the pallet. You can do this by using strapping or stretch wrapping. This will prevent pieces from getting lost or separated from the load.

### Step Four:

Before you ship your item, you want to include the address of the company or the person your shipment is going to. The more visible and clear your labeling is, the better chance your package will have a smooth delivery. Once your shipment is all ready to go, you will need to find the best carrier for your shipment. Using a shipping service list GoShip.com can help your package get from point A to point B safely and securely.
