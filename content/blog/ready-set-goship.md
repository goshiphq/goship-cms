**We’re here to help!**
-----------------------

GoShip is the industry’s latest innovation for all your shipping needs. We connect you with trusted carriers who will ensure your shipment reaches its destination safe and sound. We offer the quickest turnaround times, and an easy, hands-off way for you to ship.

**How does it work?**
---------------------

### **1\. You tell us what you're shipping and where**

_How many items? What are you shipping? A new drum set? Let us know!_ You give us the length, width, height, and weight and we’ll estimate the shipping class for you. Just make sure to let us know if it’s [hazardous](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat) or stackable so we get you the right shipper.

### **2\. We give you the cheapest quotes with the quickest transit times.**

_You’re in control._ You let us know which carrier you want shipping your cargo. We automatically order the carriers from lowest to highest price so you can automatically compare carriers all on one convenient site!

### **3\. Shipment details**

_You told us what you’re shipping. You picked your carrier. Now it’s time for the shipment details._ Tell us exactly where you’d like your shipment picked up and delivered with contact information for both transactions. Once this is done, be sure to give us detailed information about your shipment and any special instructions you have.

### **4\. Payment**

_We ensure your safety and security through our secure web browser._ We handle the payment so you’ll never have to pay the carrier directly like some other sites.
