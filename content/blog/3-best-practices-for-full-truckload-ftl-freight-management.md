3 Best Practices for Full Truckload (FTL) Freight Management
------------------------------------------------------------

### Carrier base

The key to having more opportunities in terms of freight capacity is having a wide pool of reliable, high-service level truckload carriers. It’s more likely to find capacity and carriers for your freights-specific requirements when you have a variety of carriers to choose from. Make sure to maintain a network of carriers to be available for you or partner with logistics providers who can give you access to thousands of regional and national carriers.

### Increase lead time

[Lead times](https://www.plslogistics.com/blog/what-is-truckload-lead-time-in-shipping-why-does-it-matter/) play a crucial role in the performance of your truckload freight. First, a longer lead time increases your opportunity to secure the best transportation option in terms of service, equipment, and costs. Apart from that, having more room to book the truck means you will have more accuracy and certainty on delivery dates. With a lead time of 5-6 days or more, it is possible to decently arrange shipments. But, the longer the time is between an order and the deal, the greater the chance your shipment will be on-time, successfully delivered, and be provided will all the required services.

### Use a TMS or the help of a transportation provider

It’s hardly possible to manage and optimize freight transportation without having properly customized software. Having a robust transportation management system gives you immense opportunities to monitor and analyze past and current shipments as well as forecast and plan future ones. Your truckload freight can be completely managed within a TMS. Using this tool, you can find carriers in your area, schedule shipments, save the data, track and monitor freight performance, and identify gaps and possibilities for optimizing any process that you can find. In general, the key to having high-performing full truckload freight is advanced and well-thought planning. While a transportation management system gives you deep insight into your freight transportation process, widening your carrier network and increasing lead time could potentially extend your operational performance and save on costs.
