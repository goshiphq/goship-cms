LTL shipping is an [inexpensive way to move goods](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/less-than-truckload-ltl-2221319), and it can be an excellent logistics solution for companies that are looking to save money on their shipments. It is important to carefully plan out all of the components of transportation to avoid common shipping mistakes.

Here are the most frequent shipping mistakes companies make when shipping using LTL:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Avoiding insurance**
----------------------

One of the major shipping mistakes companies can often make is trying to save money on insurance, assuming that they probably won’t be the one who will face the problem. The thing is, no matter how good the shipping service is, unpredictable situations can always happen. Dropping the insurance can lead to spending much more than you would pay for the insurance.

**Inaccurate description of the shipment**
------------------------------------------

The weight and dimensions of the freight define the price of the shipment. Declaring improper or inaccurate measures may lead to an overestimated price that could cause confusion. Make sure all the measurements and numbers are correct to avoid any misconduct and unwanted costs.

**Improper packaging**
----------------------

It is the shipper’s responsibility to ensure that the package will make it from point A to point B without any damages. Whether it is a fragile item or large load, every kind of freight needs proper packaging. Make sure to palletize your shipment or provide enough protection for your items while they are in transit.

**Assuming the shipping date is guaranteed**
--------------------------------------------

Many shippers may think that the delivery date is an imminent deadline and don’t leave room for possible delays. There are many unforeseen factors that can impact your shipment’s delivery time, such as accidents, weather conditions, and other external circumstances. Before arranging the shipment, make sure to leave some extra time for any possible delays.

**Skipping the research of shipping services**
----------------------------------------------

If shippers are in a hurry and need to get their shipment out as soon as possible, many pick the first available [LTL service](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/) without any background analysis of the service. Selecting a wrong or unreliable provider can waste your money and cause stress, so research remains a crucial part of a successful deal. Keep in mind that the lowest price is not always the best one. Reading reviews and getting more insights about the company would help you figure out if the service matches your needs. Preparation and good, organized management can help ensure success and save companies costs on their shipments. It is important to make sure that you have picked the best LTL shipping provider, accurately fill in all the documents, provided the correct data, and supplied the protection of your shipment. These easy and efficient practices would not only save you money but will keep you calm and confident about the shipping process as a whole.
