Whether you’re a business owner or an individual shipper, finding the best online shipping company to ship with is a tough call.

If you’re handling a business, the right shipping partner won’t just cut back costs on deliveries. It’ll also make your day-to-day operations smooth and issue-free. Not to mention, offering fast and affordable shipping rates to your clients can mean more sales and a booming business!

With so much at stake, you must evaluate multiple carriers and choose the best fit that will meet your goals and supply chain needs.

## Top five factors to look for in the best shipping company

### Affordability

For many shippers, pricing is the determining factor when choosing the right shipping company. Companies that offer wholesale pricing and promo codes will give you a better chance of getting a higher profit margin.

However, you should know that pricing isn’t the only factor that makes a shipping service affordable –– you should also consider the quality of service and delivery time.

In the end, it still won’t be considered a win if you choose the cheapest carrier that sacrifices the quality of service and delivery time.

With that, you must evaluate potential carriers’ affordability based on pricing, quality, and delivery turnaround times.

### Accessible Services

Finding a shipping carrier that you can rely on 24/7 isn’t going to be easy.

Does the carrier offer the particular shipping services you need? Is customer support readily available?

Reviewing what type of service you need will help you figure out which companies to reach out to. However, it gets more complicated if you’re running a business that requires more than one service. You’ll have to work with multiple shipping companies, which requires a larger investment of your time and money.

The best-case scenario would be to find a [24/7 freight shipping marketplace](https://www.goship.com) that works with multiple carriers so that your business can meet all its needs.

### Simple interface

Whether you’re shipping for business or personal reasons, nobody wants to deal with complicated logistics.

One of the worst things about finding the right shipping company is haggling with multiple brokers. Online shipping companies with a solid online platform wouldn’t require you to get into lengthy back-and-forth negotiations.

The simplest shipping options offer instant quotations and guaranteed freight capacity.

### Reliability

Shipping with a reliable freight carrier means having your goods delivered safely and on time.

Reliable carriers help companies build a good reputation, critical to growing your business and meeting client expectations.

Shipping companies that offer low costs but fail to deliver freight on time will cost you more money due to customer complaints, spoiled or expired loads, and worse, a damaged reputation.

It’s critical to choose a shipping company that ensures transparent tracking and communication, as it keeps them accountable for your shipment’s status.

### Safety

Before working with a carrier, it’s important that you check a company’s safety ratings. This gives an idea of how trustworthy a company is and how well they’ll handle your freight.

Aside from keeping accident rates low, safe freight carriers guarantee that your supply chain is on track.
