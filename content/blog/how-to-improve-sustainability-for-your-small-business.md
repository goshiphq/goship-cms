In business, sustainability refers to the process of conducting business activities in a manner that leaves little to no environmental impact. As a small business owner, improving your brand’s sustainability holds incredible benefits for the environment and your bottom line.   

## Customers Want to Purchase from Sustainable Companies  

Now, more than ever, customers are looking to shop with sustainable businesses. A recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit showed a 71% increase in online searches for sustainable goods over the past five years. This change in consumer behavior can be attributed to buyers learning more about climate change and experiencing its catastrophic impact. To oppose this existential threat, consumers are making more eco-conscious decisions and demanding that business owners adopt a sustainable approach to their daily operations.   

Positioning your business as eco-friendly and making sincere efforts to do social good can endear customers to your brand and strengthen their loyalty.   

### Certificates for Eco-friendly Businesses  

Green business certifications are awarded to businesses that adopt eco-friendly practices and are environmentally responsible. Getting these certificates is a surefire way of winning the approval of customers and investors, who converge on companies that are genuinely committed to sustainability. The certificates are typically awarded by third-party organizations, such as non-profits, government agencies, or industry associations.   

A green business certification not only proves your business’ dedication to environmental protection but also distinguishes you from the ‘greenwashers’ that customers despise. ‘Greenwashers’ are businesses that parade themselves as environmentally-conscious without having an actual social impact. Green business certifications present a perfect way to show that your business follows sustainable business practices without being mistaken for a ‘greenwasher.’   

## Reduce Your Small Business’ Carbon Footprint  

Carbon footprint refers to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, or chlorofluorocarbons) that result from human actions. It includes emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion in industrial processes, transportation, residential activities, and electricity production.   

Reducing the carbon footprint of your small business involves taking active measures to cut down greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by your business activities.   

### Learn About How Your Supplies are Sourced  

The first step towards lowering your small business’s carbon footprint is to learn about your supply sources and verify whether they are eco-friendly. Check whether the materials are derived from eco-friendly sources, such as sustainable plants and recycled materials with little to no environmental impact. It’s best to ask about the ecological consequences of the activities that occurred during the production of the materials. Such activities include responsible water usage, minimal fossil fuel combustion, proper waste disposal, etc.   

Aside from the environmental benefits of investigating supply sources, your small business also has a lot to gain monetarily from these efforts. Showing how much you care about the materials that go into your products improves your brand’s reputation, attracts investors that prioritize sustainability ethics, and wins new customers.  

### Use Eco-Friendly Packaging  

In the wake of worsening plastic pollution rates globally, using eco-friendly packaging can help reduce plastic accumulation in the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that containers and packaging contributed to about [82.2 million tons of municipal solid waste](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/containers-and-packaging-product-specific) (MSW) reaching US landfills in 2018. 

Switching to eco-friendly packaging can significantly lower the rate at the landfills are filling up by reducing the amount of plastic packaging that gets dumped in the trash. 

Eco-friendly packaging is biodegradable, recyclable, non-toxic, and made of sustainable materials using clean production techniques. Examples are cellulose packaging, corrugated bubble wrap, mushroom packaging, glassine, corn starch packaging, craft paper, organic fabrics, etc.   

### Rethink Your Current Transportation Strategy  

The transportation industry is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, accounting for up to 27% of total emissions. Hence, it would be best to rethink your current transportation strategy to find a more sustainable alternative.  

If your small business has employees, offer them the option to work from home on specific days. When fewer employees commute to work, the number of cars on the road decreases, reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion.
