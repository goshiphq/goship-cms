## How to Properly Ship Large Items?

It is important to follow a convenient freight shipping strategy to move your large items securely and exclude the risks of possible cargo damage or shipping disruptions.

### Shipment information

Before arranging any shipment, it's crucial to collect accurate information about your shipment. Depending on the transportation method you will choose, such information as dimensions, weight, commodity type, and address destination may be required. It's also useful to know special handling requirements if you're shipping dissembled parts or something [fragile](https://www.goship.com/posts/5-tips-shipping-fragile-items).

### Packaging

When you're trying to arrange heavy[ items delivery](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-ship-large-items/), the "how" can be just as difficult to figure out as the "who." Whether you sell items on eBay frequently or operate a business, your customers are depending on you to deliver a product in excellent condition. Larger items need secure packaging to ensure they arrive safely. Crating, [palletizing](https://www.goship.com/blog/palletizing-ltl-freight-everything-you-need-to-know/), wrapping, and cushioning are just a few of the many options available to make sure your large item delivery occurs without any problems.

### Choosing a shipping option

There are many options when it comes to large-item shipping. From standard parcel services to freight companies, there is a choice for the shipper. However, getting your items delivered at an affordable cost is complicated. Most of the parcel services don't take oversized items or charge a lot for overweight or over-dimensional shipment. On the other side, large freight companies might be too expensive to work with if you're an individual or a small business. The working solution can be online shipping platforms that offer [full truckload](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping/) and [less than truckload (LTL)](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/) shipping services. If the weight of your items ranges from 20,000 to 45,000 pounds, you can try full truckload shipping. If you have a single item or the volume is not big enough to rent the whole truck, you will benefit from LTL shipping.

## How Much Does Shipping Large Items Cost?

The freight costs of your shipments depend on many factors, like the number of shipping units, shipment weight, dimensions, destination, and the shipping method you are using. For example, [LTL freight rates](https://www.goship.com/blog/factors-determine-ltl-shipping-rates/) greatly depend on the [freight class](https://www.goship.com/blog/blog-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ltl-freight-class/) - a special shipment classification, while in full truckload the [mileage plays the largest role](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-are-truckload-freight-rates-calculated/). The fastest and easiest way to get an approximate shipment cost is to use an [online shipping calculator](https://www.goship.com/).

## What Is the Best Way to Ship Large Items?

Shipping heavy, bulky items can be difficult, so what are your options? If you're booking an entire trailer with a shipping service but only need a third of the space, you will pay for space you don't need. You will either have to absorb the cost of that extra space or pass it on to your customers. You could handle your large item delivery yourself. However, DIY delivery can be difficult and can take you away from what you do best: running your company. If you are a small business or sell items online as an individual, delivering items yourself is not a realistic option. GoShip is perfect for serving smaller businesses' and individuals' shipping needs.

## What Types of Oversized Items Can You Ship?

With GoShip, you can ship any types of freight, from your couch to auto parts. Here are some of the most common large items shipping services we provide:

### Furniture shipping

When shipping furniture, the freight costs can often be prohibitive. Especially when you're trying to work with long-distance furniture movers, standard shipping services, or trucking companies. Are you trying to organize a furniture delivery of large pieces? GoShip has furniture shipping options that meet your needs through our shipping services. Our professional experience and network of [freight carriers](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/) provide you with options that are cost-effective, time-saving, and easy to use.

### How to ship furniture?

Shipping furniture can be a different experience than other types of the supply chain. In many cases, the furniture may be able to be partially disassembled to facilitate safer and simpler shipping. Tables and chairs often have easily removable legs that allow you to pack the furniture into a smaller space. Crating may provide additional protection from bumps and shifts during shipping.

Adding fillers, such as customizable spray foam, can fill the voids in the furniture to prevent damage caused by vibrations. Though this can add to your shipping furniture cost expectations, it can also save you a lot of cash in terms of insurance, customer service issues, and similar problems. It's also recommended to label every part of your shipment. This way, it will be easier for the carrier to consolidate it and deliver it in excellent condition.

Knowing the number of shipping units, commodity type, weight, and dimensions is necessary to get an accurate cost estimate. Collecting correct information about your furniture items will also help prevent unwanted charges and fees, that may surface if the shipment's actual sizes don't match the actual ones. It is also important for accurate billing, so providing correct shipment information is in your best interest.

### What is the best way to ship furniture?

What is the [best way of getting the furniture](https://www.goship.com/furniture) to your customers? You could rent a full semi-trailer, even though your furniture will only fill a small portion of the entire load. Unfortunately, this means you'll either need to absorb the extra cost or pass it on to the customer.

You could load the furniture into a private vehicle to deliver. However, that will often exceed the cost of renting a semitrailer while keeping yourself or a valued employee away from the business. You could also hire long-distance furniture movers. But they're accustomed to moving used household goods. This means they may not give your beautiful furniture the attention and care it deserves.

An online shipping platform with a wide range of shipping services can be a solution. These platforms can provide both service and affordable prices.

### How much does the furniture delivery cost?

The ultimate [cost](https://www.goship.com/blog/cost-to-ship-furniture/) of moving a piece of furniture depends on many factors: weight, dimensions, commodity type, lane, accessorial charges, etc. Depending on the shipment volume and the transportation method you will choose, the price can differ.

### Appliance delivery

Shipping appliances can be difficult. Most traditional shipping companies don't have the capacity or the capability to handle large appliances such as washing machines, ovens, or refrigerators. What's more, you may not have enough appliances to fill a semi-trailer. That's where GoShip can make shipping appliances easier for you. Our appliance shipping and delivery services provide a cost-effective, easy-to-use, and time-saving way to ship appliances where you need them the most.

### How to ship appliances?

Shipping appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, or stoves require a little extra care to avoid damaging them during shipping.

* Defrost refrigerators at least 24 hours ahead of time
* Remove and pack all shelves and drawers separately
* Clean and pack ovens, all racks, knobs, and grills separately
* Washers and dryers should have their hoses removed and packed by themselves - with the dryer's drum properly secured
* All appliances with doors should have them taped and secured to avoid falling open during transit

### How does appliance delivery work?

Shipping appliances can be difficult without the use of a semitrailer. However, the majority of the time, you won't be shipping enough to fill the entire trailer. That is, you'll be paying for space in the trailer you aren't using. Hiring a private vehicle to deliver your appliances is another option. However, this can be even more expensive than renting a semitrailer. You'll also need to have an employee take time away from your business to make the delivery.

On the other hand, GoShip makes shipping large appliances much easier and more cost-effective than any other option you might have. When working with GoShip, our experienced and courteous professionals will advise you about the best options to ship your appliances, finding you the lowest possible cost through our user-friendly platforms.

### Craigslist shipping

It's possible to buy or sell virtually anything on Craigslist, from an antique pinball table to a used car. Yet even though Craigslist makes it easy to buy or sell your items, there's still the problem of how they will get to their new owners. Not every item for sale on the Internet can fit into a cardboard box. Some of them require pallets or crates because of their size or shape. That's where the extensive carrier network behind GoShip can help you with getting online logistics services.

### Craigslist shipping cost

If you are shipping large items sold or bought on Craigslist, parcel delivery service may come up as too expensive. Your shipment cost is determined by several factors, like freight type, dimensions, weight, destination, etc. You can get a quick and [free shipping estimate](https://www.goship.com/) with GoShip.

### How LTL shipping can benefit Craigslist buyers and sellers

We can pair Craigslist buyers and sellers with the carriers that best fit their budgets and schedules. With a large array of carriers to choose from, customers can rest easy. The user-friendly platform of GoShip takes the hassle out of the shipping process. Users can get a free quote and book their shipment from the same screen. Arranging for delivery by a trusted carrier through GoShip helps buyers and sellers avoid worrying about Craigslist shipping scams.

## Cross Country Items Shipping

It can be difficult to find a solution that fits your needs and your budget. This is especially true when you have to ship items infrequently enough.  Contacting a shipping company on a recurring basis doesn't make sense financially. When you choose to work with GoShip, however, we make cross-country shipping as easy and convenient for you as moving something across town.

Our cross-country shipping services will move your items across the country easily and remain affordable. Our longstanding relationships with the best freight carriers in North America mean that we can find the proper solution for your shipping needs. It doesn't matter if you're new to the shipping industry. You won't have to worry about anything when you choose GoShip.

### What you need to know about cross-country freight shipping

* How long should I expect the move to take? A typical cross-country move should take less than a week. Generally, it takes between two and five business days, depending on how far your destination is. It's good to also understand unforeseen circumstances such as holidays or weather delays.
* How much will cross-country shipping cost? The [cost](https://www.goship.com/blog/factors-determine-ltl-shipping-rates/) of your cross-country move will depend on the size of your shipment, the weight of your shipment, the distance traveled, and whether you need any additional services.

### How to ship freight cross-country?

GoShip's advanced technology and strong partnerships allow us to worry out of cross-country shipping. However, there are some simple details you should remember to make your experience even easier.

When you provide us with the most accurate information about the destination, dimensions, and weight of your packages, we'll be able to select the shipping options that work best for you. We'll also be able to help you avoid delays and unexpected cost increases that can occur when information about the shipment isn't accurate.

Choosing the correct container and packing materials are vital for ensuring your items arrive safely and undamaged. It's also important to [practice proper packaging](https://www.goship.com/blog/palletizing-ltl-freight-everything-you-need-to-know/) procedures such as minimizing empty space inside cartons, providing adequate cushioning inside containers, and distributing weight evenly on a pallet. To help eliminate confusion during shipping, always check that each of your packages or items is properly labeled. That means removing any old labels on cartons you're re-using and packing duplicate labels inside the packages for more protection against confusion.
