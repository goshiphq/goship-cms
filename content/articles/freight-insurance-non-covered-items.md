# **What is the freight insurance coverage?**

Freight insurance coverage represents a list of items covered by your official insurance document. This type of paperwork allows you to protect every piece of your cargo from possible damage. Freight insurance is a perfect option to secure your shipment. However, every insurance company has certain limitations on goods that can be covered.

Freight insurance coverage has many benefits both for individual shippers and retailers. First, you will stay away from large financial losses as you won't have to prove the carrier's fault. Second, the freight coverage allows you to get the claims paid within 30 days instead of several months. Third, your freight insurance agent will lead the paperwork for you so you can optimize the time of shipping operations.
