## What is construction logistics? 

Construction logistics is the process of transporting goods that typically include oversized construction equipment, machinery parts, steel items, or manufacturing equipment. Moving materials and equipment to remote construction sites is a challenging task. Here is where GoShipâ€™s carrier network and competitive rates step into the game. 

## Key construction logistics challenges 

### Shipping delays 

During the extreme shipping delays, retailers were pressured by customers, and manufacturers were pressured by retailers and their direct customers. Ultimately, these businesses were at some moment having a tougher time than any other link in the supply chains.  

### Transportation costs 

Often manufacturing businesses struggle to fit their budget and try to cut costs where possible, saving on shipping. However, transportation is an extremely important part. From delivery deadlines to freight safety, many factors ultimately depend on the quality of your shipping provider.
