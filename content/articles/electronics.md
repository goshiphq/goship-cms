# Electronics Shipping

<!--StartFragment-->

The process of shipping electronic items is multicomponent and requires strong attention to detail. Whether you are an electronics manufacturer or shipper, it is crucial to be familiar with the sequence of preparing electronics for shipping. Following the successful shipping strategy will guarantee you safe and on-time delivery of electronic goods. 

## What are consumer electronic goods? 

Consumer electronic goods are electronic devices used for a variety of personal needs and perform functions that simplify routine tasks, such as smartphones, laptops, television, etc. Besides, certain electronics play the role of equipment for offices and other digitized workplaces. 

Usually, electronic goods contain many fragile components, which makes them quite vulnerable during transportation. That is why it is necessary to organize your electronics shipment properly.

## How to prepare consumer electronics for shipping?

A successful electronics shipment starts with evaluating the composition of the items and separating them into pieces. This is necessary for safety purposes, so you know there is no chance of electronics being enabled during transit. Look at the item and carefully separate the accessories such as cords, chargers, adaptors, etc. 

Detached parts should be labeled and packed separately, too. It will help the customer to identify the pieces and understand how to connect them properly. Moreover, separating accessories will keep the space more organized so loose cords are not twisted together in the truck. 

### Monitoring systems

Due to the electronics price and complexity, they are recommended to be shipped with the implementation of different monitoring systems. They are usually controlled by logistics software and satellite the products during the whole shipment. 

Modern monitoring systems are capable of detecting tilts and bumps, as well as warning the driver about any possible dangerous pieces of the route. In addition, monitoring software can enhance the temperature and humidity regulation inside the truck. 

Tracking systems are quite simple to enable - you can just install the [QR tags system](https://scanova.io/blog/qr-codes-shipping-and-logistics/) in the truck so that it is visible to the customer through digital applications.

As shown from the experience, [shipment tracking](http://goship.com/posts/3-reasons-shipment-tracking-matters) matters to customers, especially when they are expecting the delivery of high-price products. 

Real-time reporting and keeping an eye on the electronics location can considerably improve customers’ satisfaction and even provide information about any additional expenses during transit.

### Electronics packaging

In the case of shipping electronic goods, it is extremely important to select the proper packaging. Electronic items are comparatively fragile, so it is better to secure them appropriately to their type and features. 

Customers trust durable packaging: if they see any signs of damage on the box, they believe there is possible damage to the product inside it. That is why it is recommended to ship electronics in strong boxes as well as utilize different kinds of inner packaging. 

#### External packaging

**Corrugated boxes** are probably the best choice for shipping electronics. These boxes consist of three paper layers and can protect devices from any type of damage, including moisturizing and contacting other items inside the truck. Sometimes corrugated boxes can be replaced by cardboard crates. However, they don’t secure the contents to the same extent as they only include a single layer of paper material. 

**Double boxing.** Sometimes, a single box cannot provide enough protection for electronic goods, especially if they are transported for long distances. In some cases, shippers can move the electronics packed into manufacturers’ original boxes. They often are quite weak and mostly designed to make a good impression rather than save the product from harm. 

Therefore, the method of double boxing resolves this problem. It is recommended to choose a container that is at least six inches longer, wider, and higher than the primary box. All the empty spaces between two boxes have to be taken up by void fillers. In the end, do not forget to seal both containers with suitable tape.

#### Internal packaging

Types of inner packaging for your electronic goods vary depending on their primary functions. Besides, the void fillers for electronics are light and they don’t increase the overall weight of your cargo, which makes them cost-effective. 

There are some popular options that are widely used to pack consumer electronics:

* **Air pillows.** This packaging type keeps the transported items away from the rigid edges on the box. In addition, air pillows stop the products from moving within their boxes. 
  Bubble wrap. You can easily cut the bubble wrap and thus regulate its size according to the measurements of your item. The air-filled bubbles provide a strong cushioning effect and thus don’t allow any pressure to distort the shape of the item.
* **Packing peanuts.** They possess good shock absorption properties and save the amortization effect while shipping fragile electronics. Also, packing peanuts are safer for electronic goods than Styrofoam peanuts which sometimes fall apart during transit.
* **Waterproof bags.** Waterproofing is a good way to hermetically pack your item so it is protected from any type of liquids that are extremely dangerous for electronics. These bags can be adapted to any size of an item. In the case of shipping some disassembled electronics, you can apply watertight bags only to the parts that can be destroyed by water. 
* **Water-activated tapes.** Water-activated tapes are the kind of tapes used after your electronic item has been fully packed and condensed into the box. The tape contains a special glue substance that is activated by water, and it finely sticks to the box. When completing the process of packing electronics, you are supposed to tape the top flaps of the box. Then, make sure you tape around every seam of the outer box. 
* **Sustainable packaging.** Since using void fillers for shipping electronics is a necessity, the sustainability of these fillers remains a serious question. Luckily, the major part of this packaging is made of biodegradable materials and can be easily reused many times. In addition, applying [sustainable packaging](https://www.goship.com/posts/sustainable-strategy-eco-friendly-packaging) can significantly reduce your shipping costs as recyclable materials are often cheaper compared to regular plastic supplies. 

### Labeling electronic goods

Labeling plays an important role in transporting electronics. The labels for electronics should be visible and contain information about their composition and properties, as well as indicate the actual number of parts of the electronic item. 

If the item has been previously disassembled, do not forget to label every single piece. The electronics labels usually involve data about the country of origin and the manufacturer’s brand marks. Make sure that you have all the brand labels on your devices. Otherwise, the unknown goods will not be accepted at the delivery.  

Boxes containing electronic goods have to be labeled, too. These stickers can also provide special shipping directions if there are any. You can learn more about labeling requirements here.

### Shipping electronics of high sensitivity

Not all electronic items can be shipped the same way. There is a range of devices that contain highly sensitive components and have to be transported with special precautions in mind. Highly sensitive electronics are more likely to get damaged by inappropriate physical conditions or contacting other transported items. 

Certain electronic devices can be susceptible to the influence of electromagnetic frequencies or gravitational pressure. To ship these units, it is recommended to apply for additional protection like aluminum shielding. Also, try to learn more about the special technical characteristics of your products to be sure you’ve secured them the best way. 

### Freight insurance

Although it may cost a little more on top of sending the parcel with electronic items, it is always best to add insurance where you can. If mistakes are made and your package is getting damaged, insurance will be cheaper than reimbursing and losing customers in the long run.

## How to ship electronics: Transportation of electronic goods

There are different services available for shipping electronics, and the one that fits you most depends on the needs of your commodity: 

* **[Expedited delivery](/blog/what-is-expedited-shipping).** It is a great option for time-sensitive shipments. Electronic items are often sent as gifts, and sometimes electronic suppliers need to ship goods urgently. 
* **[Truckload shipping](/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping).** It is a suitable option for shippers who ship large volumes of electronic goods that are enough to fill in the truck trailer. It is also a safe bet since you have a dedicated truck for just your freight, which means increased protection and less chance for freight damage.
* **[LTL shipping](/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping).** Less-than-truckload shipping is a type of transportation when several shippers share a truck for their goods. Because loading and unloading take more time, it is a great mode for shippers who have smaller shipments that are not time-sensitive. 
* **White glove service** or [service for hiring helpers](/resources/get-help-with-taskrabbit). Packaging electronics often requires additional effort and resources. If you are not familiar with electronics packaging, you can use help.
* **Heated transport.** Some electronic products are sensitive to low temperatures. If they are shipped in too cold conditions, especially during the cold seasons, certain components of these devices can get spoiled for good. That is why the sippers are getting more and more interested in using heated transport with built-in thermo-regulation systems. They can easily maintain the optimal temperature regime as long as you are on the road. 

## How long does electronics shipping take?

Shipping electronics is considered to be time-sensitive. If electronics are performing functions of equipment for some customers or are sent as gifts, they are often expected to be delivered urgently. 

It is important to think over the consistent shipping strategy to make sure you meet all the timing requirements. Also, we advise counting a few more factors that influence the duration of electronics shipping.

* **Distance.** The longer it is, the more time-consuming your shipment gets. Also, do not forget to include some time spent for possible traffic congestion and driver’s stops. If you want to optimize the overall time, try to expedite the route in advance to avoid long detours or unreliable pieces of a highway.
* **Transportation mode.** Apparently, it is better to arrange a full truckload shipment for timely delivery. However, less than truckload shipments remain more affordable, so if this is the transportation mode you’ve chosen, please be aware the driver will take his time to pick up and drop off all the other goods. 
* **Seasonality.** The delivery speed significantly slows down when the roads are loaded with many other trucks. This usually happens in terms of the [peak season](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-your-small-business-for-peak-shipping-season). On the other hand, in times of bad [weather conditions](https://www.goship.com/posts/preparing-for-hurricane-season), there is a bigger risk of trucks getting stuck or making repair stops. 

## How much does electronics shipping cost?
