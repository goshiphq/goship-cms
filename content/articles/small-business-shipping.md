# Shipping for Small Businesses

*When it comes to small business shipping, many business owners are not sure where they should start. Do they need to set up shipping accounts? Work with one company, or many? What's the best solution for their company's specific needs? What are the best shipping options for small businesses? GoShip.com's extensive experience with small business shipping solutions means we can help you find the right answers for your company's needs.* 

## What are the best shipping options for a small business logistics?

Small business owners often have to wear many hats. Managing everything from the production process to the ultimate [customer experience](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/) can be overwhelming. Shipping and logistics are the crucial parts of any business, whether it's small or large. For small businesses, shipping means even more, because it lets you provide a customized customer experience and retain your customers. Retailers know that their job is not done once the sale is closed. Every aspect of the interaction they have with consumers is an opportunity to impress them --- or to lose their business forever.  

Today more than ever, retail logistics plays a fundamental role in building the best possible experience for customers. Fast, hassle-free shipping is no longer a premium, value-added service. It's the expectation, and retailers need to concentrate on making their deliveries as quickly as possible. This is often easier said than done, especially for small to midsized businesses. Whereas large-scale firms such as Amazon can leverage their volume to create the most effective and efficient logistics, smaller companies don't have the same luxuries. This is where retail shipping can be a lifesaver for many businesses.  

By taking advantage of everything this method offers, they can provide their customers with the best shopping experience from beginning to end. However, managing small business logistics is not as complicated as it may seem. GoShip.com gives you unsurpassed options when it comes to integrating retail shipping into your existing shipping strategy. You can either ship using [truckload freight shipping](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping/) or [less-than-truckload shipping](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/). 

## What is the best way to ship for small businesses? 

### Plan ahead 

Early planning is the key to smooth and well-organized business growth. While you are certainly planning supplies delivery, inventory, stock management, and business strategy, logistics can be often left out. But planning in small business shipping is critical. With a prepared approach, you will save costs, secure more capacity, and will avoid shipment disruptions and delays. Eventually, successful shipments convert into satisfied customers. 

### Clear communication 

No matter how small or big your business is, you will work with other companies and business partners. To avoid any bottlenecks on your supply chain and production, make sure to clearly communicate your ideas and requirements to parties you are working with. The more clarity and transparency there is in your communication, the better your partnership will influence both sides. 

### Working with a small business shipping service  

Trying to manage all the branches of your business at once can turn into a nightmare. Properly managed logistics and shipping require time and effort. That's where shipping platforms come into play. Your logistics partners will handle most of the burden, like searching for better freight rates, [carriers](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-ltl-carriers/), shipment tracking, and billing.

## Benefits of LTL shipping for small businesses 

LTL carriers consolidate multiple shipments from different companies onto the same truck. This allows businesses to transport their goods affordably and quickly, even when they don't have enough to fill an entire trailer. Using LTL gives customers the convenience of having automatic tracking alerts as an advantage for their retail logistics needs. By working with these carriers, retailers that take advantage of them gain benefits such as: 

* Reduced costs: Because trailers are filled with multiple loads, each retailer only pays for the capacity it actually uses. This means participating companies don't pay for the space they don't need.
* Greater efficiency: With the power of this method behind them, businesses in the retailing sector can streamline their operations. They can avoid needless air freights, chargebacks, and noncompliance fees that can bog down their logistics. This results in better scorecard performance across the board.
* Ensured compliance: By working with an experienced LTL carrier, retailers can prevent penalties that stem from noncompliance. They can rest assured that all elements of their shipments will be handled in the proper fashion.
* More consistency: Utilizing LTL residential delivery for order fulfillment means businesses will hit their delivery windows more consistently. Consumers will enjoy having their packages arrive on their doorsteps within the timeframe specified. 

## Benefits of truckload shipping for small businesses 

Truckload freight shipping is a convenient and most common way of shipping freight over-the-road. If you have enough freight to fill a 48 ft truck trailer, full truckload shipping can be a beneficial option for your business. Here are a few comprehensive benefits of truckload shipping for retail logistics:

* Faster transit times. Since truckload trucks are dedicated to just your freight, it likely that FTL loads will reach the destination faster than LTL ones. There's no transit stops in truckload shipping, which also makes it faster.
* Reliability. No stops during transit lead to less freight handling, which reduces the risk of freight damage, theft, or loss.
* Costs. Although full truckload shipping is usually more expensive, if you have large volumes of freight and ship frequently, in the long run, it may be more cost-efficient than using other shipping modes.
