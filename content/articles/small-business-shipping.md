# Shipping for Small Business

When it comes to small business shipping, many business owners are not sure where they should start. Do they need to set up shipping accounts? Work with one company, or switch them? What's the best solution for their company's specific needs? What are the best shipping options for small businesses? GoShip's vast experience in small business shipping means we can help you find the right answers to all your logistics questions. 

## What are the best shipping options for small business logistics?

Small business owners often have to wear many hats. Managing everything from the production process to the ultimate [customer experience](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-customers-experience-through-shipping/) can be overwhelming. Shipping and logistics are the crucial parts of any business, whether it's small or large. For small businesses, shipping means even more, because it lets you provide a customized customer experience and retain your buyers. Your sales are not likely to grow without working on a shipping strategy that will allow you to deliver the ordered items fast and safely.

Today more than ever, retail logistics plays a fundamental role in building the best possible experience for customers. Fast, hassle-free shipping is no longer an exclusive service. It's the expectation, and retailers need to concentrate on making their deliveries as time-efficient as possible. Putting efforts into building your logistics strategy can streamline many business operations and help you optimize your budgeting on every level. 

Retail shipping is one of the keys to making your business profitable and attractive for bigger groups of customers. Taking advantage of everything this shipping method suggests, you can provide your buyers with the best shipping experience from beginning to the very end. Moreover, managing small business logistics is not as complicated as it may seem. GoShip offers you unsurpassed options when it comes to integrating retail shipping into your business scheme. 

You can either ship using [truckload freight shipping](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping/) or [less-than-truckload shipping](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/). 

## What is the best way to ship for small businesses? 

### Plan ahead 

Early planning is the key to smooth and well-organized small business logistics. While you are certainly planning supplies delivery, inventory, stock management, and business strategy, logistics can be often left out. Adopting the early planning approach, you will save costs, get more capacity, as well as avoid shipment disruptions and delays. Eventually, successful shipments convert into satisfied customers. 

### Clear communication 

No matter the scale of your business, you will work with other companies and partners. To avoid any bottlenecks in your supply chain organization, make sure to clearly communicate your ideas and requirements to the parties you are working with. The more clarity and transparency there is in your communication, the better your partnership will influence both sides. 

### Working with a small business shipping service  

Trying to manage all the branches of your business at once can turn into a nightmare. Properly managed small business logistics and shipping require time and effort. That's where shipping platforms come into play. Your logistics partners will handle most of the burden, like searching for the best freight rates, [carriers](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-ltl-carriers/), shipment tracking, and billing. Platforms like [GoShip](https://www.goship.com/) provide you with tools for instant freight quoting, regular shipment updates, and helpful tips for improving your supply chain.

## Benefits of LTL shipping for small business

It is recommended to pay attention to the most prevalent shipping modes you might be using for your transportation needs. LTL carriers consolidate multiple shipments from different companies onto the same truck. This allows businesses to transport their goods affordably and quickly, even when they don't have enough items to fill an entire trailer. Using LTL gives customers the opportunity to receive automatic tracking alerts and thus stay updated on the load's actual location. By working with LTL carriers, retailers can gain numerous benefits, such as: 

* **Reduced costs:** because trailers are filled with multiple loads, each retailer only pays for the capacity it actually uses. This means participating companies don't pay for the space they don't need.
* **Greater efficiency:** with the power of this method behind them, businesses in the retailing sector can streamline their operations. They can avoid needless air freights, chargebacks, and noncompliance fees that can bog down their logistics. This results in better scorecard performance across the board.
* **Ensured compliance:** by working with an experienced LTL carrier, retailers can prevent penalties that stem from noncompliance. They can rest assured that all elements of their shipments will be handled properly.
* **Improved consistency:** using LTL residential delivery for order fulfillment means businesses will hit their delivery windows more consistently. Consumers will enjoy having their packages arrive within the specified timeframe. 

## Benefits of FTL shipping for small business

Full truckload freight shipping is a convenient and most common way of shipping freight over the road. If you have enough freight to fill a 48 ft truck trailer, full truckload shipping can be a beneficial option for your business. Here are a few benefits of full truckload shipping for retail logistics:

* **Faster transit times.** Since truckload trucks are dedicated to just your freight, it is likely that FTL loads will reach the destination faster than LTL ones. There are no transit stops in truckload shipping, which also makes it faster.
* **Reliability.** No stops during transit lead to less freight handling, which reduces the risk of freight damage, theft, or loss.
* **Costs.** Although full truckload shipping is usually more expensive, if you have large volumes of freight and ship frequently, in the long run, it may be more cost-efficient than using other shipping modes.
