# Manufacturing Equipment and Machinery Shipping  

Industrial companies face many challenges while striving to increase the efficiency of their shipping strategy. Shipping machinery parts or bulky and large manufacturing equipment requires special handling, high volumes of carrier capacity, and robust transportation management.  

Manufacturing equipment and machine parts can be quite challenging to ship. Whether you’re shipping conventional machines, sewing or milling machines, finishing equipment, CNC machines, or other machinery parts or manufacturing equipment, it is crucial to find a reliable shipping partner, choose reliable freight insurance, and apply [the best practices](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-ship-heavy-equipment/) for a smooth shipping experience. 

## How do you ship small manufacturing equipment and machinery parts? 

In manufacturing and production, there are many types of equipment and machinery like sewing and milling machines, CNC and cutting machines, cranes, grinders, etc. These machinery parts don’t require a lot of truck capacity and are usually shipped through LTL or less-than-truckload shipping. [LTL shipping](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/) is a reliable and cost-efficient way to ship manufacturing equipment. Here are the key factors that define the cost of LTL freight shipping: 

*   Freight class  
*   Weight  
*   Dimensions  
*   Destination  
*   Mileage 
*   Additional services 

## How do you ship large industrial equipment? Flatbed shipping for machinery transport  

There is a limited pool of opportunities for industrial shipments when it comes to transportation modes. Most machinery and manufacturing equipment items qualify as oversized freight and are shipped via flatbed trucks or flatbeds, or are moved in a closed trailer as a full truckload shipment. Flatbeds have an open trailer, without a roof and walls, created specifically for oversized shipments. There are different types of flatbeds: 

*   Flatbed 
*   Step Deck 
*   Double Drop 
*   Side Kit 
*   Conestoga 
*   Hot Shot 
*   Multi-Axle 

These trailers can handle up to 48,000 pounds and are one of the most suitable modes for manufacturing equipment and industrial machinery transportation. Use this mode when your items are extremely large, or require complicated loading.  

## How much does it cost to transport machinery and equipment?  

The ultimate cost of transporting manufacturing equipment transport depends on many factors but primarily depends on shipment dimensions, size, commodity type, LTL freight class, and distance. This is why it is critical to provide accurate and precise information about the shipment.

### Do I need freight insurance for industrial and manufacturing equipment transport? 

There is a default carrier coverage liability for all shipments. However, it is highly recommended to purchase additional, full-value freight insurance to have peace of mind. Most of the manufacturing equipment shipments are successful, but errors and damage can occur in transit. To be fully protected and confident about your shipment, add full-value freight insurance to protect your freight and your bottom line.
