### Heavy Equipment Shipping 

[Shipping heavy items](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/large-item-shipping/) like large equipment, machinery, vehicles, or auto parts can be quite challenging.  Whether you’re shipping a car to another state, or regularly transport commercial vehicles or equipment, it is crucial to find a proper shipping partner, choose convenient freight insurance, and apply the best practices for a smooth shipping experience.  

Any shipment, that exceeds size limits and requires dimensional flexibility can be considered as a heavy shipment. Cars, motorcycles, trucks, tractors, cranes, forklifts, large auto parts, and similar items all fall under the category of equipment and machinery. In the United States, and wide or oversize freight is a load that is wider than 8.5 feet (2.59 meters). The maximum permissible load width is 8.5 feet (102 inches), the max allowed height is 102 inches, and the legal length is usually 48 to 53 feet. If a load weigh more than 46,000, it is considered oversized, too. 

GoShip offers heavy equipment and machinery shipping services as we work with [flatbed carriers](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-flatbed-shipping/) across the US. If you need to ship any industrial equipment or machinery, whether it’s one piece or a load of goods, you can rely on GoShip for convenient transportation.

## Machinery Transport 

The logistics industry covers many different verticals, from steel and manufacturing to [food and bev](https://www.goship.com/industries/food-beverage-supply-chain/). Machinery transport falls under a slightly different category which the logistics industry refers to as specialized freight shipping, which is typically used by industrial businesses such as oil and gas, mining, metal manufacturing and more.  

Whether you are [buying](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-effectively-buy-heavy-equipment-online/) construction equipment or [selling](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-sell-heavy-equipment-online/) agriculture equipment, GoShip can provide the means for shipping your heavy load. Backhoes, excavators, tractors - shipping construction equipment and agriculture equipment is possible with this type of service, which GoShip conveniently provides. In the next two sections, we will dive into the essentials of machinery shipping and connect you with the best fit specialized carrier.

### Agriculture Equipment Shipping 

Shipping farm equipment, such as tractors and agricultural machinery, is considered [specialized shipping](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-are-specialized-freight-shipping-services/). GoShip has the largest network of carriers in the US that specialize in flatbed and oversized freight. [Oversized loads](https://www.goship.com/blog/buying-oversized-items-online/) will cost more because they are larger and heavier. They also require additional services such as extra vehicles and [reliable insurance](https://www.goship.com/resources/freight-insurance/).  

You will need to prepare your tractor or farming equipment for transport. Here are some steps you can take to ensure safe delivery: 

* Drain any extra fuel. This will reduce the freight weight thus reducing the shipping costs.  
* Remove all loose parts or secure parts that may become loose during transport.  
* Remove attachments and ship them separately. It’s especially important to do this with oversized equipment. This will make shipping safer and cheaper.  
* Plan out load and unloading strategy. Will you be able to drive the farming equipment onto the truck or does it require a crane? Planning will reduce loading and delivery time and you’ll become a shipper carriers will you want to work with again.

## Automotive Shipping 

Whether you’re moving doors or hoods, panels or plastic moldings, shocks or coil springs, bumpers or grills, full transmissions or anything in between, automotive shipping is a challenging task for shippers if they don’t have the right partners. With a sprawling range of sizes, weights, and dimensions, auto parts might find their way into LTL or FTL shipments, into dry vans or onto flat beds, moving via parcel or via freight. Combine this mess of variables with high-value shipments that are often fragile, inconsistently shaped, and susceptible to damage, and you need a pre-vetted, reliable carrier for your auto parts shipments. 

Fortunately, GoShip works with a professional, reliable network of local, regional, and global carriers that have been pre-vetted and sport a robust background in [automotive shipping](https://www.goship.com/industries/auto-parts/). We assist with any paperwork, freight tracking, insurance, and handling freight claims.  

While GoShip can take care of your automotive parts once they're ready to move, it’s on you to get them ready to move. To set your shipment up for success, make sure you: 

* Choose the right packaging. Protecting your freight is important, and auto parts often need extra padding, sturdier packaging, and consideration for their weight. 
* Clean and empty lubricants before shipping. No matter carrier quality, freight gets jostled on the road. You don’t want oil leaking everywhere or a loose particle to scratch pristine surfaces. 
* Disassemble and individually pack components. Don’t let the movement during transit put the weight on easily broken parts. 

 

### Best Way to Ship Large Car Parts

When it comes to shipping large auto parts, you have two main options: [full truckload (FTL)](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/truckload-freight-shipping/) and [less than truckload (LTL)](https://www.goship.com/shipping-services/ltl-freight-shipping/). Ultimately though, if you are not familiar with the complexities of auto part transport, it is best to turn to professionals. GoShip grants you access to more than 50,000 FTL and LTL carriers so your specific auto part transportation needs are sure to be met!  

Because auto parts are often fragile or prone to other types of damage such as rusting, it is crucial to choose adequate protection packaging. This will save you money in the long run on filing freight claims for damaged items. You will want to disassemble parts and drain any liquids before packing them separately. Additional protection such as wrapping or taping may also be helpful to enhance safety. Crates are the most common and dependable type of packaging and stacking your goods onto pallets is also recommended due to its ease of moving and solid protection. 

The price of shipping you auto parts is highly variable depending on many factors such as origin and destination, dimensions, weight, type of auto transport service, and seasonality. Shipping auto parts can be quite costly at times; however GoShip can connect you with a working solution at a reasonable price with the right carrier for your specific auto transport needs.
