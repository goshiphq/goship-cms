## What does LTL stand for? LTL meaning 

LTL stands for less-than-truckload, which means a typical LTL shipment takes only a part of a freight trailer's space. LTL freight shipping is a transportation method when your shipment takes only a part of the carrier's trailer. Your freight is stacked into pallets, crates, large boxes, and is combined with shipments from other businesses into a single trailer. This makes LTL freight, or less-than-truckload freight, a reliable and cost-effective solution for shippers and businesses who have small amounts of goods. It is more flexible than a full truckload and offers many benefits to individual shippers and small businesses. 

It is usually combined in hubs, facilities, or distribution centers, and is unloaded in special terminals, where receivers can pick up their orders.  Shipments can be handled multiple times while in transit. This means that it's the most cost-efficient way to ship your larger-than-parcels items without the cost of a full trailer. The remaining space is filled by other companies, each only having to pay for a portion of the trailer being used. To better understand how LTL shipping works, read our guide on [What Is LTL Shipping](https://www.goship.com/posts/ltl-freight-shipping-for-beginners). 

## What is LTL freight and when to use it? 

LTL freight shipping is a great and cost-efficient way to move goods, but it is not quite for everyone. If you are considering LTL freight as an option, you should understand how it works and what do you need to do in order to successfully ship freight.  

## LTL freight shipping is perfect for you, if: 

* Your shipment is beyond parcel size limits. If your freight is larger than standard parcels and can be fitted on a couple of pallets or crates, it is a perfect option. Typically, less-than-truckload shipment will include from 1 to 7 pallets of freight. So, if your load is beyond size limits but not enough to take the entire trailer, you should try it. 
* You can pack and load freight b yourself. LTL carriers will often expect you to have the shipment fully prepared before loading. It is highly recommended to pack and secure your freight, with you or your agent being able to help load freight into the trailer. For this service, you can get additional help with our partner -- TaskRabbit. This service offers extra hands when you need help with packaging, loading, unloading, etc.
* You understand the time specifics of LTL freight shipping. Because LTL involves shipments from multiple shippers that ship to different destinations, it often takes longer to deliver freight. Depending on the destination and route, LTL shipping takes 2-5 days on average.

## Who is an LTL carrier? And what are the types of LTL carriers? 

An LTL freight carrier is an individual or a company, that provides less-than-truckload transportation services to shippers and third parties. To better choose a carrier for your type of shipment, it's important to understand different types of LTL carriers:

* Local carriers. Local or small carriers form a majority of freight carriers in the US, accounting for 60% of all motor carriers. They usually operate within a small area within 80-100 miles. Typically, local carriers don't have a lot of equipment but can be a better solution if you need last-mile delivery or special services.
* Regional carriers. Their carriers are somewhere in between, moving freight through the local yet bigger area, or a region. They usually have more trucks and cover an extensive territory. Regional LTL carriers often work with other carriers to fulfill transportation gaps.
* National carriers. The largest players in the game are called national carriers. These are large companies that operate throughout the country, have tons of equipment, and industry expertise. Sometimes, these carriers can offer better rates and service levels. GoShip.com works with all types of professional carriers to match your purpose. 

## How much does it cost to ship LTL freight? And how LTL rates are calculated? 

There are many factors that affect LTL freight rates, but there are a few key things they are based on. LTL rates greatly depend on the freight class, a special [shipping code](http://www.nmfta.org/pages/nmfc) that is determined by National Motor Freight Traffic Association. Freight class is determined by the density, freight stow-ability, ease of handling, and liability of an LTL shipment. 

 At GoShip.com, we use our freight class calculator to automatically calculate your freight class for you. The distance your LTL load will travel also determines the final cost.  Here are the key factors that define the cost of LTL freight shipping:

* Freight class 
* Weight 
* Dimensions 
* Destination 
* Mileage 
* Additional services 

## What factors determine LTL freight shipping [rates](https://www.goship.com/blog/factors-determine-ltl-shipping-rates/)?  

### Distance 

Typically, the longer the haul, the higher the price. Some carriers only serve a specific region, and transferring the shipment to another carrier will increase the cost. At GoShip.com we do this research for you and match your freight with the best lane and best price. 

### Freight Class 

[Freight class](https://www.goship.com/blog/blog-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ltl-freight-class/) is defined by a variety of factors. It is determined by the weight and density of your freight. If you have a lower-class freight, it means that it's heavy, dense, and difficult to break making it easy to handle. Higher-class freight is typically lighter, less dense, and difficult to handle due to being fragile. At GoShip.com, we utilize our freight class calculator to determine your class, so you don't have to! 

### Additional Charges 

Services that go above the normal pick-up and delivery require additional fees. These could include lift gate use, inside delivery, limited access delivery, or freeze protection. 

## What is an LTL freight class? 

An LTL freight class is a specific classification, created by [NMFTA](http://www.nmfta.org/) (National Motor Freight Traffic Association) to categorize LTL freight. LTL freight class is based on a number of characteristics and pricing differentiation.  

 Mostly, it is defined by a shipment's density. This way, bigger and lighter shipments with low density will cost more to ship, than dense and heavy freight. All commodities are divided into 18 classes,  from Class 50 to Class 500, and a unique NMFC code is attached to each commodity. Freight class plays a prominent role in defining the final cost of LTL shipping. 

## How to prepare LTL freight for shipping? 

### Documentation 

It's important to always make sure the address for pick-up and delivery is correct. After you book a shipment with GoShip.com, you will receive a [bill of lading (BOL)](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-the-bill-of-lading-bol/). The bill of lading is the most important document in the shipping process. So, it is crucial to provide accurate, exact information, and avoid mistakes. Ensure that the document is correct before turning it over to your carrier. 

### Shipment information 

Accurate dimensions are very important to you and the carrier. The carrier relies on accuracy to maximize their capacity and prevent any fees toward your shipment. This also applies to the weight, freight class, [density](https://www.goship.com/blog/density-affect-ltl-shipping/), address destination, etc. If any of the necessary data is inaccurate or uncertain, the shipper can end up paying fees and additional charges. To avoid delays and unwanted costs, double-check your shipment information. 

### Packaging and labeling 

Proper packaging is crucial for LTL freight shipping. LTL shipments are handled numerous times before arriving at their destination, so for safe transportation, freight needs to be secured.  It's important and highly recommended to stack your freight onto pallets or crates if possible. There are also different types of freight packages, but some of the most commonly used are:  

* Crates 
* Pallets 
* Boxes 
* Bundles 
* Barrels 

 To make the shipping process easy and fast, pack your freight accurately before loading. Use tapes and seals if needed, to keep the shipments tight, fixed, and consolidated. This will significantly reduce your chances of damage. To fully prepare your LTL shipment, we recommend referencing our [GoShip.com Packing Guide](https://www.goship.com/blog/how-to-safely-prepare-your-ltl-freight-shipment/). 

## LTL vs FTL: What is the difference between LTL shipping and FTL shipping? 

There is a [difference](https://www.goship.com/blog/full-truckload-vs-less-than-truckload-what-is-the-difference/) between less-than-truckload (LTL) and full truckload (FTL) shipping. In LTL shipping, your freight does not take an entire space in the trailer. Also, there are other shipments from different shippers combined with your freight. Basically, in LTL, you share the truck space with other shippers. In full truckload, you pay and use the entire freight trailer, even if it does not necessarily full.

## What LTL freight services do we provide? 

* Liftgate pickup. The liftgate is a piece of special equipment at the rear of the truck used to simplify loading and unloading. If you need assistance in loading your freight, consider choosing this option. A liftgate is used for almost every residential delivery, but make sure to discuss it before scheduling a shipment, since it is considered an extra service. 
* Inside-delivery. [Inside delivery](https://www.goship.com/blog/what-is-inside-delivery/) is when your freight is delivered right to the door of your facility or residence. There are two main types of inside delivery: residential and commercial. If you don't request inside delivery, the driver will just leave the shipment at the exact same place where it was unloaded from the truck. 
* Protection from freezing. With GoShip.com, you can choose refrigerated equipment if your shipments require temperature control. 
* Delivery appointment. A delivery appointment is the agreed time and date of freight arrival between the receiver and the carrier. This option should be considered when you ship to a warehouse or facility that has strict delivery schedules. 
* Limited access shipping. The limited access category actually covers a substantial [number of locations](https://www.goship.com/blog/limited-access-shipping-location/) like private houses, schools, churches, etc. It is important to define if your delivery access is considered remote by the carrier. 
* Freight insurance options. Often, carrier liability is not enough to guarantee a shipment's safety and cover the value in case of damage. GoShip.com wants to secure our customers and offers full-coverage freight insurance options. 
* Shipping to and from Canada. Apart from cross-country shipping, we also provide shipping to and from Canada. If needed, GoShip.com can assign a professional customs broker that will help you with all the required documentation and customs clearance.
