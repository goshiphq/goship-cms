What is Truckload Freight?
--------------------------

Full truckload freight shipping means moving freight that fills an entire truck trailer, or the majority of a trailer's space. A truckload shipment is a shipment that consists of more than 6 pallets of goods. Trailer for truckload shipping can handle up to 43,000 lbs, with an average size of 48 to 53 ft in length. Truckload shipping is the most common type of over-the-road freight transportation. Carriers who move truckload use different equipment types, including dry vans, flatbeds, and refrigerated trailers.

What are the benefits of truckload freight shipping?
----------------------------------------------------

### Reliability

Truckload shipping is the safest and most reliable shipping option. Unlike less-than-truckload (LTL), there is no freight handling during transit, which significantly reduces the chances of freight damage. Enclosed trailers also help ensure your freight is protected from the external influence of weather and other factors.

### Speed

Truckload transit times are usually much faster than less-than-truckload. Carriers don't have to make loading and unloading stops while in transit. Thanks to a more consistent route, your freight can be delivered faster.

### Diversity

Truckload shipping has a wide coverage of trailers and modes. This means you can ship any type of commodity through full truckload due to the variety of equipment available. Dry van, refrigerated, and flatbed trailers can move everything from household goods to industrial, oversized freight.

### Cost-Efficiency

Usually, truckload is more expensive than LTL. However, it can be cheaper if you have heavy, high-volume loads. In that case, shipping will be a much more cost-effective option than booking several LTL shipments.

What are the types of truckload freight shipping?
-------------------------------------------------

### Dry Van Shipping

Dry vans are sealed, fully enclosed trailers that are mostly used when shipping full truckload. These trailers work for shipping any goods that don't require temperature control. Dry vans are safe and protect your freight from external influences.

### Refrigerated Shipping

### Flatbed Shipping

Flatbed trailers are open trailers with no roof. This equipment is used for moving oversized and bulky freight that doesn't fit into enclosed trailers. Pipes, rigs, heavy equipment, machinery, auto parts, and steel pieces are commonly shipped with flatbeds.

What is the difference between full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main difference between FTL and LTL shipping is that truckload shipping suggests filling an entire truck trailer with your freight, while LTL means only filling a small part of the trailer's space.

LTL shipment is a shipment from 1 to 6 pallets (up to 20,000 pounds), and a full truckload can be from 6 to 26 pallets and take up to 45,000 lbs.

Additionally, there is a difference between the pricing of the two modes. LTL shipping rates include freight classification -- special codes that represent different commodity types. You can learn more about [freight class](https://www.goship.com/blog/blog-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ltl-freight-class/) and [density-based pricing](https://www.goship.com/blog/density-affect-ltl-shipping/) to figure out which option works for you. Truckload shipping doesn't involve freight classification, and freight rates mostly depend on traditional factors like weight, dimensions, address, etc. Usually, a full truckload is more expensive than LTL, but if you have large volumes of freight, FTL will be more cost-efficient.

Essentially, both FTL and LTL can be beneficial for your shipment. However, it depends on many factors like freight volume, commodity type, lane, and address destination. Truckload shipping can be a better solution for shippers who move large quantities of goods since it becomes more cost-efficient in that case. With enough freight to fill in the

How are truckload freight rates calculated?
-------------------------------------------

Despite truckload freight rates depend on some unchangeable factors, they can be fluctuating. To understand the nature of truckload freight rates, let's take a look at the key factors that determine truckload freight rates:

-   Origin and destination address
-   Shipment weight and dimensions
-   Seasonality
-   Lead time and flexibility
-   Urgency
-   Fuel surcharge
-   Commodity type
-   Assecorial charges

Truckload freight rates can vary not just because of the weight, but also because of spikes in seasonal capacity demand and volatile fuel prices. It's important to know that the more time you give a shipping company or the carrier to provide a freight rate, the lower it will be.
