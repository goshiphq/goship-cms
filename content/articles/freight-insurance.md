Here at [GoShip.com](https://www.goship.com/), we know how important it is for your shipment to arrive safely to its destination. We want our customers to have the best experience possible when shipping with us, and that’s why we have freight insurance options available to you to help guarantee your goods are covered in case of any unpredictable circumstances.

## **What is freight insurance?**

Freight insurance gives freight additional protection in case of loss or damage. Unlike freight liability, it suggests full coverage for your shipment regardless of the causes of the damage. Having freight insurance not only lets you simplify the refund process but lets you save yourself time and stress.

## **How can freight insurance help me?**

Adding freight insurance to your shipment gives you unlimited benefits. Here are some of the most compelling reasons to get additional protection for your freight:

* 100% protection of your freight and its value
* Claims are paid within 30 days compared to 9 months without insurance
* You don’t have to prove the carrier’s fault
* All the paperwork is completed for you by our insurance provider

We work with [Falvey Insurance Group](http://falveyshippers.com/), industry professionals that assist customers with all necessary paperwork. Our partners will do their best to ensure your freight is safe and covered.

The option of adding insurance can help guarantee a fast and easy delivery process. Thanks to our service and partners, the claims process is painless and easy in the case of damage or loss.

## **How much does it cost?**

This means that the final cost of your freight insurance is based upon commodity type, weight and more. The insurance purchase option is available at the checkout, so you will see the price during the last step of booking a shipment.

Please note that there is a list of items that are excluded from the insurance coverage, such as bills, cash, mobile phones, precious metals, gemstones and works of art worth more than $20,000 per piece, perishables, hazardous materials, alcohol, animals, plants and vehicles.
