Here at [GoShip.com](https://www.goship.com/), we know how important it is for your shipment to arrive safely to its destination. We want our customers to have the best experience possible when shipping with us. That’s why we have freight insurance options available for you to guarantee your goods are covered in case of any unpredictable circumstances.

# **What is freight insurance?**

Freight insurance coverage is an official document that totally or partially insures the value of your products. Freight insurance gives freight additional protection in case of loss or damage. Unlike freight liability, it suggests full coverage for your shipment regardless of the causes of the damage. Having freight insurance not only lets you simplify the refund process but lets you save time and stay away from stressful situations.

## **How can freight insurance help me?**

Adding freight insurance to your shipment gives you unlimited benefits. Here are some of the most compelling reasons to get additional protection for your freight:

* Protection of your freight and its value. Cargo insurance will help you avoid big money losses that are often caused by frequent [freight shipping returns](https://www.goship.com/posts/reverse-logistics-how-to-deal-with-freight-shipping-returns). Often, the freight damage occurs due to external reasons you can't control like traffic congestion or bad weather.
* Claims are paid within 30 days compared to 9 months without insurance. You won't have to wait too long to finish the reimbursement process. This will save you much time and won't interrupt your financial operations.
* You don’t have to prove the carrier’s fault. Freight insurance functions as an official document showing the freight loss or damage have been caused by the carrier. This will help you avoid many administrative procedures and fines. 
* All the paperwork is completed for you by our insurance provider. You won't have to spend time managing big volumes of paperwork. Instead, you'll be able to focus on the core business and transportation operations. Thus, you'll make your supply chain time-efficient and deliver your products with no delays.
