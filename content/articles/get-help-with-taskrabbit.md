## GoShip & TaskRabbit Partnership

### *Get Help With Your Shipments!*

GoShip and TaskRabbit, an online task platform, have joined forces to ease the burden of stressful freight shipping for shippers and provide a smarter and more accessible all-in-one shipping solution.

## What is TaskRabbit?

[TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/services/goship?utm_source=partners&utm_medium=GoShip&utm_campaign=shipping) is a global network that connects people who need help with “Taskers” to handle tasks such as packing, moving, and more. Acquired by Ingka Group (IKEA Retail) in 2017, TaskRabbit operates across the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy, and is headquartered in San Francisco.

With GoShip’s vast carrier network being leveraged and the skilled Taskers found on TaskRabbit’s platform, this partnership will provide access to quality assistance for all your moving and shipping needs including packing, unpacking, assembly of products, intercepting shipments, and so much more for those seeking convenience in their daily lives.

If you’re shipping freight with GoShip, you can hire a Tasker through the TaskRabbit platform to get help with an extended set of services including help with moving in and out, assembling and disassembling furniture, packing, and errands.

## Additional freight shipping services offered through TaskRabbit

### Moving in and out

Changing office locations or moving can be a stressful and burdensome challenge, but not with Taskers by your side. You can hire a Tasker to help with packing, disassembling items, and loading and unloading them.

### Packing & unpacking

Packaging plays a critical role in freight shipping, but few shippers have the time and resources to provide superior packaging to all of their loads.

### Heavy lifting and shifting

Now, the only thing you have to do with your freight is to book a shipment – leave the heavy lifting to Taskers. If you need extra hands, you can hire Taskers to help.

### Furniture assembly

Shipping furniture is easy when you hire a reliable shipping provider and skilled Taskers who will handle all the work.

## GoShip & TaskRabbit FAQ

### **How can TaskRabbit help me streamline my shipping needs?** 

Taskers are available in 40+ categories and can assist with things such as shopping for and delivering packaging materials, packing/unpacking your shipments, or lifting & shifting your shipment to its pickup location.

### **What if I don’t know how to package my freight or what type of packaging I need (pallet, skid, or a box)?**  

Best practices for freight shipping includes palletizing freight, as it is the most known and common way to secure freight. Pallets are not the only type of freight packaging, but are the most common and preferred, especially when shipping LTL.

### **Is there any discount for my first task with TaskRabbit?**

Yes! Use code **GOSHIP10** for $10 off your task! (Please note that it is for the 1st time users only. Expires 6/30/21. One time use. Valid only in the U.S. No cash value. Void where prohibited).

### **Do I need to be present for a Tasker to pack/load my freight? How many Taskers do  I need?**

No, but you are responsible for overseeing and directing the work of your Tasker so if you won’t be home, you must ensure all needed items are in a place the Tasker can access without your presence and that you give your Tasker any instructions required for them to complete your task correctly.

Taskers are available for small (1 hour) to large (4+ hours) jobs, so it is most likely you need one Tasker to complete your packing. If you require large, heavy items to be lifted/shifted, you may need to hire an additional Tasker to provide an extra set of hands. Please include approximate weight/height measurements in the task description.

### **Are Taskers GoShip employees?**

No, Taskers are independent contractors who use the TaskRabbit platform to connect with people like you for work!

### **If I need Taskers at my freight’s origin and destination, do I need to hire different Taskers?**

Yes, you will need to book different Taskers.

### **Do Taskers travel with my freight?**

No, Taskers remain in the metro area that you booked in.

### **When do I book a Tasker? What if my shipping plans change, can I reschedule my Tasker(s)?**

Taskers are available to help with your shipment in advance of scheduling a GoShip pickup, or after. Taskers can be booked for the same day or up to 14 days in advance. You can reschedule/cancel a task without penalty up to 24 hours before the scheduled task. If you cancel within the 24 hour window you will be charged the Taskers 1 hour fee. Use the chat thread feature on TaskRabbit to inquire with the Tasker about their availability for your rescheduled date/time.
